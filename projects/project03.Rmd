## General Instructions

This page outlines the instructions for the first project. You should
have a file `project03.Rmd` in your RStudio workspace where you can
work on the project. I find that students prefer having a consistent
format for the projects, so I will attempt to keep the format the same
throughout the semester.

On the due-date, your group is responsible for completing three elements:

1. A short (about one-page single spaced) description of your work answering
a subset of the questions below. Please submit as a Google Doc in your shared
group Google Drive folder.
2. A Google Slides presentation of your results, also submitted in your shared
drive folder.
3. Giving a presentation based on your slide show. This should be 8-10 minutes
in length. I suggest having one member drive the slides and the others rotate
describing the results.

As described on the syllabus, the project will be graded as either Satisfactory
or Unsatisfactory. I will provide additional feedback that you can address in
the next project.

## Specific Instructions

The data for this project is similar to the previous one, but this time reviews
come from Yelp. I created the data set based on what is provided by the
[Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/) project. As with before, I
have selected reviewers with a large number of reviews. However, this time
you have a number of different variables to work with. Variables that
are available to focus on (either as a prediction or as an unsupervised
grouping variable) are:

1. author gender (binary categories; automatically guessed using first names;
yes there are a lot of problems with this, but still interesting to look at)
2. author name (100 authors in each dataset)
3. stars (1-5)
4. business categories (as in the notes)
5. business names

As with the first two projects, you are encouraged to take the data in whatever
direction you find most interesting. The only thing I require is that you focus
a non-trivial amount of your work on integrating the unsupervised approaches
covered in Notebook13 into your analysis. Note that gender has too few
categories to used unsupervised on its own and business names likely have too
many.

If you need some questions to get started, I am happy to provide some of these.
However, there are so many directions to go in, I only want to do this if you
are struggling with an idea.

## Groups

Each group is working with a different city's data. You should be able to
download your data set from within the `project03.Rmd` file.

**Group 1**: `charlotte`

**Group 2**: `calgary`

**Group 3**: `pittsburgh`

**Group 4**: `phoenix`

**Group 5**: `las-vegas`

**Group 6**: `madison`

**Group 7**: `cleveland`

**Group 8**: `toronto`

## Notes

While working through the project, I typically find that many groups ask for
help writing the same bits of code. Any notes that I want to share about how
to do specific tasks will be added here as we work through the project.
