## General Instructions

This page outlines the instructions for the first project. You should
have a file `project01.Rmd` in your RStudio workspace where you can
work on the project. I find that students prefer having a consistent
format for the projects, so I will attempt to keep the format the same
throughout the semester.

On the due-date, your group is responsible for completing three elements:

1. A short (about one-page single spaced) description of your work answering
a subset of the questions below. Please submit as a Google Doc in your shared
group Google Drive folder.
2. A Google Slides presentation of your results, also submitted in your shared
drive folder.
3. Giving a presentation based on your slide show. This should be 8-10 minutes
in length. I suggest having one member drive the slides and the others rotate
describing the results.

As described on the syllabus, the project will be graded as either Satisfactory
or Unsatisfactory. I will provide additional feedback that you can address in
the next project.

## Specific Instructions

This project uses a collection of movies reviews from IMDb. This is a classic
data set in machine learning. You can read more about the collection as a
whole [here](http://ai.stanford.edu/%7Eamaas/data/sentiment/). Each group will
be assigned a slightly different subset of the corpus to explore; each subset
considers the differences (or lack thereof) between different subsets of the
corpus.

The goal of your project is to apply the methods we have developed so far to
explore your corpus and understand what features distinguish the two categories
you have been assigned. Here are some things you should consider addressing:

- How accurately can you classify the groups based on the text on the
validation data?
- What terms most distinguish the groups? Are there any bigrams or skip
grams that are particularly important? If you look at just verbs or adjectives
does anything different pop up?
- Looking at negative example from your best model, do you find it easy to
identify the correct class or not?
- If any of the most indicative terms seem surprising, apply KWiC to the
data. Does that help explain why the term is predictive?
- Is there a difference in the parts of speech used between the groups?
- Create a confusion matrix and describe any patterns (interesting or not).

I recommend looking into most of these, but feel free to skip parts that seem
less relevant to your question. Likewise, consider extending the questions if
an interesting idea comes from your analysis.

You will find that most (perhaps all) of the results you want to show are
tables and example reviews. Getting these into a slide show can be a bit
annoying. Some approaches include: (1) highlight and copy texts from the
clipboard, (2) screen shots of small tables or (3) save the table as a csv
file, read into Excel or Googe Sheets, and paste as a table from there.

## Groups

Each group has a slightly different part of the corpus and a different
prediction task. The full corpus contains reviews with 1-4 or 7-10 stars. You
should be able to download your data set from within the `project01.Rmd` file.

**Group 1**: `imdb_neg_extreme` Compare reviews of 1 star to those with 4.

**Group 2**: `imdb_pos_extreme` Compare reviews of 7 stars to those with 10.

**Group 3**: `imdb_polarity_extreme` Compare the 1 and 10 star reviews.

**Group 4**: `imdb_polarity_mod` Compare the 4 and 7 star reviews.

**Group 5**: `imdb_vs_extreme` Compare the extreme (1/10) reviews to the
moderate (4/7) ones.

**Group 6**: `imdb_cats_neg` Do a multiclass comparison of the 4 different
negative scores.

**Group 7**: `imdb_cats_pos` Do a multiclass comparison of the 4 different
positive scores.

**Group 8**: `imdb_cats_all` Do a multiclass comparison of all 8 categories.

## Notes

While working through the project, I typically find that many groups ask for
help writing the same bits of code. Any notes that I want to share about how
to do specific tasks will be added here as we work through the project.
