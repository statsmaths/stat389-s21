## Creating a Corpus of Wikipedia Documents

For Project 4, unlike the other projects, you will be constructing your own
corpus of documents to work with. These documents will come from the text of
Wikipedia articles. The functions needed to do this can be loaded by reading
in the `wiki.R` script:

```{r}
source("wiki.R")
```

The function `wiki_get_pages` takes a vector of page names, queries the
MediaWiki API, and returns a data frame with the HTML parsed version of
the page, as well as information about all internal links included in the
page. Here, we will use it to grab the pages "Coffee" and "Tea". Note that
the function requires that you set the language of Wikipedia that you are
interested in grabbing data from.

```{r}
pages <- wiki_get_pages(c("Coffee", "Tea"), lang = "en")
pages
```

The functions are smart and create a local cache of files that avoids having
to query the API over and over again.

Now, we will use the function `wiki_expand_pages` to grab all of the pages
that are linked to from the pages in the data frame `pages`. That is, returning
data for all pages that are linked to from the Coffee or Tea pages.

```{r}
exp_pages <- wiki_expand_pages(pages)
exp_pages
```

We now have a corpus of 1131 pages. We will use the function
`wiki_get_pages_text` to extract the raw text from the Wikipedia files.
This requires parsing all of the HTML records and can take a minute or
two to finish running, but note that it does not grab any additional data
from the MediaWiki API. The function itself returns each paragraph as an
individual row; we use the function `tapply` to combine these into a single
document.

```{r}
wiki <- wiki_get_pages_text(exp_pages)
wiki <- tapply(wiki$text, wiki$page, paste, collapse = " ")
wiki <- tibble(doc_id = names(wiki), text = as.character(wiki))
wiki
```

Finally, we need to run the NLP annotation engine over this data set. Here is
the code to run and save the results using the **udpipe** backend:

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cnlp_init_udpipe("english")
anno <- cnlp_annotate(wiki)$token

write_csv(wiki, file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea.csv"))
write_csv(token, file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea_token.csv.gz"))
```

The saved results can then be read-in and used without having to re-create the
data set. We will use this data in several of our upcoming notebooks.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
use_virtualenv("/Users/admin/gh/stat389-s21/env", required = TRUE)
cnlp_init_spacy("en_core_web_sm")
anno <- cnlp_annotate(wiki)

token <- anno$token
entity <- anno$entity

write_csv(wiki, file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea.csv"))
write_csv(token, file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea_token.csv.gz"))
write_csv(entity, file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea_entity.csv.gz"))
```

## Latent Dirchlet Allocation

We will now proceed to the methodological topic for today. For consistency,
let's read back in the Wikipedia data and tokens files.

```{r, message=FALSE}
wiki <- read_csv(file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea.csv"))
token <- read_csv(file.path("data", "wiki_coffee_tea_token.csv.gz"))
```

Today we are going to investigate a method for *topic modeling*. This is an
unsupervised task that seeks to identify topics within a corpus of text. What
exactly is a topic? Mathematically speaking, it is usually defined as a
probability distribution over a collection of words. Words that have a high
probability within a topic tend to classify the topics themes in a colloquial
sense. For example, a topic that captures the idea of baseball would have high
probabilities on words such as "base", "player", "strike", "umpire", "team",
and so forth.

We will be use a model today called Latent Dirchlet Allocation, or more commonly
LDA. Given a fixed number of topics and fixed set of words (called a *lexicon*),
LDA assumes that documents consist of a random collection of words
constructed according to the following model:

1. Each document is randomly partitioned into topics. For example, one document
may be 20% in Topic A, 70% in Topic B, and 1% in the remaining 10 topics.
2. Each topic is similarly assigned as a probability distribution of all the
available words.
3. When choosing words to create a document, pick a topic at random
proportional to the topic distribution of the document, and then pick a word
proportional to the chosen topic.
4. The number of words in each document is assumed to be fixed, and there is
assumed to be no relationship between the words in each document.

This model is a great example of the adage that "all models are wrong, but
some are useful". Clearly, this is not how documents are constructed, and
words are not independent of one another. However, the approximation is close
enough to produce a useful abstraction for detecting themes within a corpus of
textual documents.

You will notice that the description above is in some ways backwards from
reality. It assumes that we know the distribution of the topics over the words
and documents but do not know what words are present in the documents. In fact,
we know the words but not the topics! This is an example of a Bayesian model.
If we wrote down the assumptions rigorously, we could invert the probabilities
using Bayes' Theorem. That is, instead of knowing the probability of the
documents given the topics, we can determine the probability of the topics given
the documents. It is not possible to do this analytically, however, and a
simulation method is needed to figure out what distribution of topics over the
words and documents is most likely to have produced the observed data.

As a final note about the method, the name comes from the standard distribution
used to determine the topics (the Dirichlet distribution) and the fact that the
topics themselves are never observed (that is, the are *latent*).

Now, let's actually compute an LDA topic model. The first step in creating a
topic model is to compute a TF matrix. I tend to use only nouns, adjectives and
adverbs for this task (verbs are okay too, if you would like).

```{r}
X <- token %>%
  filter(upos %in% c("NOUN", "ADJ", "ADV")) %>%
  cnlp_utils_tf(min_df = 0.001, max_df = 0.5, doc_set = wiki$doc_id)
```

Next, we use the `sm_lda_topics` function. It requires passing the TF matrix
as well as selecting the number of topics. Because this requires a simulation
method, running the topic model can take a few minutes to complete. The results
should be consistent from run to run because I have set the random seed inside
of the implementation. The output contains two components, which we will save
as individual data frames.

```{r}
topic_model <- sm_lda_topics(X, num_topics = 16)
topic_docs <- topic_model$docs
topic_terms <- topic_model$terms
```

The first data frame provides the probability distributions of the documents.
It tells us own much weight each document receives from each topic.

```{r}
topic_docs
```

Looking at the documents with the highest probability for each topic begins to
show what the LDA algorithm has found in each topic. Can you categorize what
themes some of these topics capture?

```{r}
topic_docs %>%
  arrange(topic, desc(prob)) %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  mutate(doc_id = paste(topic, doc_id, sep = " => ")) %>%
  use_series(doc_id)
```

Similarly, the terms data frame gives the probability distribution of the terms.
These probabilities can be quite small; rather than giving then on a raw scale,
the function returns the logarithm of the probability in the column named
`beta` (for this reason, these values are all negative).

```{r}
topic_terms
```

Looking at words for each topic gives another view for understanding the
detected topics. In many applications, we do not have useful titles of
the documents, and using the word distributions is the only automatic way of
describing each topic.

```{r}
topic_terms %>%
  arrange(topic, desc(beta)) %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  summarize(sm_paste(token))
```

How do these match up with the topics that you identified by the document
names?

## Visualizing Topics Models

Looking at the output of an LDA model in R can be a bit difficult. Let's see
a better way to visualize the results. Start by loading the topic.R file, which
contains one additional function:

```{r}
source("topic.R")
```

Now, we will used the function `topics_create_json` to create a JSON file that
contains the topics generated by the LDA model. We will write it to the local
disk using `write_json`:

```{r}
topic_json <- topics_create_json(topic_docs, topic_terms, wiki, truncate = 1000L)
write_json(topic_json, "wiki-topics.json")
```

Now, go to the website [Topic Model Visualizer](https://statsmaths.github.io/topic-explo/build/)
and upload the JSON file that we just produced. It should create an interactive
visualization for you to explore.
