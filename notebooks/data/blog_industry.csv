doc00001,5,"Ok, wow can be said about Tyke's day. This was crazy weird and sorta hectic for Tyke. Many people would disagree but it was still very busy. School was fine and the Tolo assembly was good, especially the video. Haras and Karla did great jobs in their parts. They are just so sexy. As school progressed it got a little bit worse all the while but it was nothing too bad. After school Tyke and Skippy got all ready for their ping-pong tournament. It was pretty danged fun. Quite a few people there in fact. Tyke took out Macaroon in the first round but Tyke played really well. Macaroon did a pretty good job but Tyke's return spinners were too much to handle. The second round saw Tyke facing off against Skippy. Which was bad. Tyke was never able to take a commanding lead really and just lost it for a little bit. He took a 7-6 lead and it was game point but Skippy came back and took the next 3 points to win. It was, as Tyke believes, an upset but Skippy did deserve the W as he just played better than Tyke. After a little while Ekul and the Sly Lion boys came over to partake in the action. Ekul owned hardcore. He is very very good and he did even bring his own paddle and shaving cream with which to smooth off his paddle. Yeah, he is hardcore serious. But extremely good too. He won it all although he didn't get recognition for it necessarily because of his standing at another school. But he was the best there. And that is what matters most. After this Tyke went home and this is when it got crazy. He and his mom talked for a little about Tyke's Tolo outfit. He put on the outfit and got it for her and they tried to decide what to add. Then they thought about where they could find some good ideas after the internet didn't come up with anything good. So Tyke's mom told him to go get The Great Gatsby movie from Blockbuster. So he did. While there, this girl said she really liked his Aviators and then asked if he was from Yakima. Tyke said he just bought the shirt that had Yakima on it last night at Value Village and that he hadn't done the Habitat for Humanity thing. Then the girl said that she had a friend who did ""the stupid th...oh not that it was stupid."" Tyke interrupted and said that he didn't do it so he didn't care. Then he got the movie and walked away. He came back and he and his mom were watching it when his dad called and he had a doctor's appointment scheduled for the day and he was calling to say that he had to go to the hospital to have them look at his little problem. So that was something weird. But Tyke and his mom watched Great Gatsby when all of a sudden Macaroon showed up unexpectedly at the back door while the movie was on. So that was weird. Then he came in and sat down for a while as they watched and got ideas. So finally Tyke found what he was doing. And then Tyke's dad called again. And he told them that he had to get surgery tonight on this hernia thing he has and that was totally unexpected. But it wasn't major so there wasn't need to worry. So Tyke's mom had to rush to the hospital and Tyke and Macaroon went down to Redmond again to try and get some of Tyke's costume stuff finally. But the place was closed. So they went to Value Village to shop some more for Tyke. He ended up finding a good suit jacket to go with his get-up and then he had pretty much everything he needed besides the hat and suspenders. But those can be purchased tomorrow still. At Value Village they saw some fellow Issy's and talked for a little. Then they went back home and watched some hoops before going to the lacrosse game at the school. It was just Tyke, Macaroon, and Piggy J for a while which was cool. Piggy was insane and wearing shorts. Then he kept asking Tyke for the blanket that was smartly accompanying Tyke and keeping him warm. But Tyke politely declined everytime. After a while all of the ladies came. Dotti, Haras, Tina, Purdy, Mandy, Tig, etc. So they talked for a while. And Haras gave Tyke some stoned crackers which tasted really good and Tina talked to Tyke about her gross-out things and Dotti and Tyke talked about his hectic day. It was pretty much heaven. A very cold heaven. But then Tyke had to go to the hospital to pick up his dad's car cuz it was there and he couldn't drive. So he went back to his house and Dotti came and picked him up. They drove down to Bellevue and had a great talk. It was really really great and Tyke didn't want it to stop. But Tyke's mom called as they were about to get on 405 and said that they couldn't pick up the car anyway. So they had to turn around and go back to Tyke's house. But they still got to keep talking and that was extremely enjoyable. After getting home they went in Tyke's house and chatted it up there for a while. Then Tyke's parents got home at about 11 and they went upstairs and talked to them for a little. Tyke's dad seemed pretty good considering he had surgery a little while ago. So he is fine. But then Dotti left and Tyke and his mom talked about their plans for tomorrow and filling up Tyke's brother's car's gas tank and picking up Tyke's dad's car and going out to Redmond again for some costume things and then going to Dotti's at 11:50 for Activity A of Tolo. So Tyke will be getting up before 9 to do all of that. Man, this is a crazy time right now. But it is fun. A lot of good things happening. And nothing that is that bad. So wow, Tyke needs to get some sleep. This is just weird."
doc00002,6,"Once upon a time, there was a sensitive young man. He had boyish good looks, and deep sad eyes. He was what we would call a vegan these days. He neither smoked nor drank. He advocated free health care, no pollution, limited forestry, animal rights and etc. Today's urlLink progressives would've loved him. His name was Adolph Hitler. Hitler was a progressive. That's my theory. He and his cronies didn't come to power by promising to destroy a generation, and ruin the continent. They came to power by promising a lot of ""puppies and kittens"" cowplop. They probably believed it themselves early on."

doc00006,3,"urlLink William McKinley (1843-1901) This biography focuses on the Spanish-American War. It was written by Lauren Calone. From the site: William McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio, on January 29, 1843, the seventh child of William and Nancy McKinley. William briefly attended Allegheny College, and was teaching in a country school when the Civil War broke out. Following the war, he studied law, began practicing in Canton Ohio, and married Ida Saxton. At age 34, McKinley won a seat in Congress. He was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee. Those who served with him attest that in his votes, he often sided with the public and avoided private interests. During his 14-year tenure with the House, McKinley became a leading expert on tariffs. He later became governor of Ohio, serving two terms. As a congressman, governor and later, president, McKinley, a man of moderation and compromise, held firmly to two beliefs: favorable tariff to stimulate American business and limited coinage of silver. William McKinley was nominated as the Republican candidate for president with the assistance of Mark Hanna, a wealthy industrialist. Favoring tariffs as protection for prosperity for the nation and a limit on silver, he defeated William Jennings Bryan, whom many feared as a threat to the government in the election of 1892. As president, McKinley was converted to the idea of international bimetallism—an agreement of several countries to use both gold and silver as the basis for their currency. He later favored maintaining currency by using the gold standard, opening the way to passage of the Gold Standard Act of 1900."

Well, it's not important. I have a problem. I have to get up at 6:00 in the morning. This is too early for my system, or at least this is what my system is telling me. You think, 6 isn't that bad. 11:00 to 6:00 is only 7 hours. On a good day. So when I wake up, I go take a shower, and then go back to bed. This is my problem. I need my sleep, but I need to get up. This hasn't been solved yet, and has caused many rushed mornings. I need a solution. A real one. ""Go to bed early"" does me as much good as ""Sleep upside-down"". /personal rant (putting the /quip at the end of posts is fun.

doc00014,5,"I commence with last nights dream as an introduction; I was on a Viking longboat sailing around an Eastern European country, somewhere not dissimilar to Prague in the Czech Republic. In the night sky are three moons, each carrying its own evil grin toward me, along the city streets lie animals in cages, possessed by an evil force as is each building, only the mortar stop it from escaping. I have a pewter staff though, on one side is the Christian Cross engraved; another shows Father Time - I cover the staff in a dark liquid and then this repels the evil; the three moons shrink in to one; the animals return to their normal form and the buildings return to their previous inanimate state. The Longboat continues to sail around the city and gradually the howling of wolves stop as I use my staff to repel evil. Eventually the longboat makes one final turn and it hits a black wall, the wall doesn't smash the boat; instead it splits in half letting us pass through and only then do I realize that its just a fair ground ride. So to today, or this evening more importantly; with less than an hour left my prom date confirmed that she would be going to the prom and subsequently, I got changed and in due course, got to the venue. I played my part as a gentlemen better than ever but she just didn't seem interested me. She even left without informing me and so I too left and found myself watching Paul McCartney at Glastonbury, ending his set with Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [the reprise]. We're Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We hope you have enjoyed the show Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We're sorry but it's time to go. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely.

My life has a habit of playing songs to be ironic at me. Oh well, I guess that might be the last time I see her, so is the way of puppy love. Well good luck to everyone else as I seem to be out of it. I'll end this with irony; We're sorry but it's time to go."

doc00017,3,"This beard is getting out of control. Whenever I perspire my face feels like it's covered in wool. Not the most comfortable itchy sensation. During lunch today, I had another octogenarian moment: Eating some yogurt, I completely missed my mouth (c'mon...it's not like I've been feeding myself for almost 23 years now...) and instead spread a nice trail of key lime yogurt (in its Ecto Cooler green glory) all across my chin, and consequently my beard. Not only did I have to wash my face and beard, but afterward I had to dry both by paper towel, and then brush my facial hair. News flash, clean shaven folks: Beards get unruly if you don't daily shampoo and comb them. But enough...if I keep this up, I'm going to end up shaving the beard off, and then the middle aged ladies at work won't compliment me anymore. And as everyone knows, I love the ego boosts. :) The apartment hunt continues. I think I've got a v. good lead in Dewitt, a 'burb of Syracuse.

doc00020,3,"Yep, that is my name. Several months ago, I came to my husband and confessed that I had a few credit cards he didn't know about. I had been thru a huge problem with my depression and all the bills were behind, we were financially in horrible shape. It was a rough few months for us. I screwed up again. I didn't remember one of the cards. This morning the collections agency calls, and talks to Tommy. He asked me about it, I still didn't remember. After Tommy went to work, I called the number on the phone and talked to them, they reminded me of the card. Not a good thing. I guess I had just blacked it out or something. I don't know what happened. THey had been trying to call, but I won't answer the phone if I don't know who the company listed on the caller ID is. I don't have to hang up on telemarketers that way. So, all this time, they have been calling ,and I assumed they were just a telemarketing company. Sheesh, I'm an idiot. Now, I am scared. When we went thru this a few months ago, he told me ""never again"" he wouldn't do this again,and I know he was on the verge of leaving me. I am praying he doesn't leave me. I can't handle that. I do love him, I have been doing soooooo good the past few months. I have been sticking to the budget he gave me, like glue. I have been making do with what grocery money we have, and not been complaining at all. I have even been bringing him the recipts of what I pay and spend. I have felt so much better about myself, and everything. And now this. I have screwed up bigtime,and I know it. I don't have a clue what to do. I don't know what to say to him. He isn't speaking to me. At all, not a word. Pretty much ignoring me. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it, and he told me ""you don't want to talk to me right now"". I know I have pissed him off beyond belief. I even got most of the house clean before he got home from work this morning. (he only had to work about an hour) Which for me, is good."

doc00026,2,"The most common question that I am asked when people find out what Kris does is, “Aren’t you lonely?”. What people don’t seem to realize is that there is a difference between being lonely and being alone. The truth is that I kind of enjoy this time to myself; it gives me the opportunity to explore my interests and to be independent. Besides, I don’t understand why everyone pities me – Kris is the one off in the middle of nowhere on some barge without television or Internet or women for miles and miles. I, on the other hand, get to spend our time apart in the comfort of our house, with our friends and with easy (and frequent) access to the charge card. Personally, I think that Kris is the worse off of the two of us, so aim your pity in his direction. In fact, a recent experience made me realize just how scary this lifestyle of frequent travel can be for divers: Kris and I decided to switch banks and, since he was going offshore that night, I was in charge of making any necessary changes. Before he left, I had him sign and void a check for me to give to his company's accountant for the direct deposit of his paycheck. When I called the next morning, I was informed that, despite my legal rights as his wife, and the fact that we share a joint account, it was company policy that only the employee could make changes to the direct deposit. Why, you may ask, must his company be so difficult? Perhaps its time I introduced you to Jodi. Jodi is the name of the man that every diver fears for he is the man who is sleeping with your wife while you are away at work. Nothing pleases a seasoned diver more than to regale the newlywed, young, wide-eyed tender with tales of the dreaded Jodi. In fact, Jodi is so scary, that many tenders have quit their jobs for fear of their young brides finding comfort in his arms. Jodi was actually named during the Viet Nam war. Originally, Jodi was the military name given to draft dodgers. The idea was to train young draftees to despise Jodi for staying behind while they honorably served their country. Of course, as a young, naiive soldier, you were told that Jodi was a filthy being who, not only sherked his duties as an American, but who also took the opportunity, while you were away, to move in on your unsuspecting wife. So, first you learned to hate Jodi; then you learned to associate Jodi with the enemy; next you learned to hate the enemy. Isn't brainwashing fun? Amazingly, still today, the fear of Jodi lurks in the hearts of all married men who work offshore. The reason I bring up Jodi is to illustrate the point that some divers cannot trust their wives. This sad but true fact is so common that it explains why Kris’ company will not allow me to make changes to his banking information. I assure you that I am not just jumping to conclusions; the accountant told me point blank that this was the reason for the policy. When Kris first got his job, he told me that a tender at his company had recently quit. Apparently, he was married to a professional cheerleader who seemed to think that her husband would be diving for oil out of their backyard. Or, at least, that is all I can figure because this young man was sent offshore on his first job and, two days in, received a frantic phone call from his wife threatening to divorce him if he did not come home immediately. Some women just can’t handle the pressure. The saddest stories that I hear are of women who take their husbands' earnings and skip town without warning. These women are famous in commercial diving legend and are the inspiration for strict company policy when it comes to paychecks. Somewhere between Jodi and these glorified-prostitute wives, divers must be very cautious about whom they trust. The companies that they work for are forced to implement some extreme policies to protect their workers. Whether you dive or not, I guess it is a pretty sick world out there. Everyone handles the stress differently. Take me, for example: I am not a cheater or a thief, but my shoe collection is quietly growing…"

doc00028,2,"future topics in the near future i intend to cover the following topics briefly. the blogging medium : is it creating intimacy or distance and under what circumstances. my time at the village vineyard church plant: what can be learned looking back. aids in africa, or kids in cambodia: the consequences of being divided in your desire to be a means of providing some social justice. what i learned at the rock and roll hall of fame. indie rocker: to be or not to be i am an easily encouraged individual. so when JNF posts to my blog that i should put my feelers out based on the strength of some of the songs posted on the songwriter site, i actually makes me think that this is a possibility. for a number of years i knew my weakness was song-writing. hanging out with jim zartman only proved to deepen my understanding of that weakness. But all the while i prayed that God would give me the gift of song-writing. for years i prayed this. I noted other talents as to keep my over-inflated ego filled with hot-air. e.g.. perhaps production was my main gifting, i can arrange and correct, but not compose, or i can play all these instruments so. . . I lived with John Reuben for a year. I saw him on the road and off. It was that year that i realized i was not built for the road. For the lack of relationships at home, for the tiredness, the stresses of business, the constant self-promotion, the constant battle of not believing your own self-promotion for humility sake, merch., ticket sales, fakeness, groupies. . . i just dont think i could take it. But i have to admit, the allure of fame does make me forget about all the hardships i saw john endure. It's not even money. artists dont make money. Real money is inherited, new money goes to businesspersons, the artist is given his cut. And even with the top percentage of successful artists, their income pales in comparison to the previously mentioned categories. Cash is such a tangent. As if that was the only thing concerning me. I think my point is simply, dont become an artist for the money, become a musician because you want to throw away all relationships you have at home for a disenfranchised tires and usually penniless existence as a nomad, entertaining people as they indulge in drink or prior to illicit sexual activity. What a life. I'm not going to fool myself into thinking there's some kind of platform for Jesus on the indie rock circuit. personally, i just dont buy it. Not that i would judge any of my friends who felt called to that. In fact i would probably encourage them in it. But of all who have ventured out, i haven't heard stories or seen the tremendous fruit you would think such a platform may yield. I have seen tired eyes, fallen lead singers, and even more discontent. i dont want that life. the alternative If i love performing and writing music, what are the alternatives to refusing the road? playing columbus: just for fun, could be cool. real success would be illusive. writing and giving away music: on the web, maybe get hooked up with a publishing house. could be cool, but not satiate the performance facet of the diamond. would not be able to really sell records either. do something completely different. . .

I could also tell you that the most powerful handgun that I ever fired was a Super Python 445 magnum. Get the point?? I was and probably somewhere in the deep recesses of my body is a gun fanatic. Every since I was young, my father held an interest in projectile weaponry and it seeped over into my genes. My father owned a mossberg bolt action shotgun ( antique ) and I used to just take it out of the leather case just to touch the butt of it. IT gave me this tingly type of feeling. The first gun I have ever own was a Raven .25 automatic. It had 5 in a clip ( bullets ) and 1 in the hole ( chamber). That had to be the cheapest gun made to man. The whole pin was exposed inside the chamber. The pin is the piece of metal that hits the bullet that makes it fire. So when the bullet fires the chamber slides back and another bullet is loaded. Uh, with an exposed pin, one jam and the pin breaks and the gun is worthless. Of course, you would think I would learn after 3 pins. That raven was the first gun that my father ever found in my room when I was living on Elder. I remember walking in and my father hand the gun in his hand. He asked me "" What's this ?"". I told him, ""it's a Gun pa"". He wasn't too amused. He just let me do what I wanted to do and said that I would feel the consequences if I ever got caught with a gun. I always thought that he meant he would try to beat me but that was not the case. My second gun was an Italian Beretta 92F model deluxe. That gun was the sweetest gun. My third was a .45 Cal StarFire. It was a compact Combat style 45. It was a bulldog of a gun. My Fourth Gun was an AMT Hardballer .45 cal competition pistol. This gun was huge and the kick was crazy. After that, came the Desert Eagle .50 cal. This gun was probably the only gun that ever scared me. I brought a Mossberg Assault Shotgun with the collapsable stock. A .22 beretta with the wallet holster. This shit was HOT!!! The holster was an actual wallet and the gun went right in the middle. If anyone tried to rob me, I would go into my pocket to remove what looked like my wallet and I would hand them a huge surprise ( 6 shots to the face ). I had the AT-22 Feather target pistol. I came across a Walter PPK 32 Cal. This gun was the Rolls Royce of the Gun world. I came across a small 22 Cal. Derringer with two shots that I got into every single club I ever went to. Hint Hint: Grab your chain and put the gun on the chain. Don't put the gun on your chest, place it to your back. The Chain looks like a choker and not many bouncers check that far up your back. A harrington 22 Cal. 9 shot revolver. This gun was cool because most revolvers come with 6 shots, this one had 9. After 6, you think we are done, whoah , here comes three more. Finally, my pride and joy, my Glock 20 40 Cal with an extended 40 shot clip and silencer. I miss that gun. I got caught with it and until this day, I miss that gun like I lost a child. That is not all of them but the main ones that I remember. Once things were getting kinda crazy, my life was synonymous with carrying a gun everywhere I went. Where ever you saw me, Fish had a gun. It was common knowledge that from my area, I had the best aim, knowledge, and mechanical skills when dealing with guns. I took it to many levels buying magazines and researching everything about the subject. I used to go to the gun shows and try my best to steal as many guns as possible. Why not buy??? Fuck that, gun shows are expensive. Funny thing, I had so many guns in my house and when you are young, you tend to blabber. So, I made up a story that someone broke into my house and stole my guns. I even broke my window to make it look believable. Could you believe that I had some people come up to me saying they knew who took my shit??? I was pretty amazed at the whole thing. Guns. Wow. I think that I replaced my love for guns with poetry. That is the only thing that I could figure out as to why I love poetry soo much. So, do I own guns now?? Of course I do. Do I have them in my possession ?? heheeehehehe. No. Would I tell you where they are??? Sure, after I am dead. I'll leave you a note. So much to write but most is incriminating! LOL Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish"

doc00037,6,"Welcome to the second edition of ""Adventures with Kitties"" starring Tigger as ""Little Bastard"" and Pooh as ""Little Bitch""! In today's episode, it is early Monday morning and I've just gotten out of the shower. As I am applying moisturizer to my skin I hear some strange sounds coming from the living room. I walk towards the sounds and immediately see Tigger sitting up on the ledge looking down at the front door. At what? I have no clue. Its obviously a cat thing. I walk a bit further in and see that the cover is off one of the heating vents on the floor near the living room window. My first thought is ""Crap, Pooh is in the vents!"" so I walk over, remove the whole thing and start calling to her. I hear nothing. I'm wondering what to do and I consider getting the catnip as bait for her. I replace the cover for the vent because god knows Tigger would certainly climb in (he's done it before). I turn around and, to my surprise and amusement, there is Pooh outside at the back door meowing to get in. I let her in but I'm a bit puzzled as to how she even got out there. As far as I'm aware, I don't think the vents lead outside - at least not that quickly/directly. The only other option I can think of is that she went through the living room window. See, we don't have a screen on that window just yet - and last night I left it slightly open so as to let in the cool night air. The thing is that it wasn't open any more than 3 inches but maybe thats enough. If she did escape that way she had quick the long drop down! Cats are just weird. Or maybe thats just our cats :) Anyhoo, today I feel normal. And what I mean by that is that we went to a wedding this weekend and I got really nicely toasted - so I'm now feeling non-alcoholic and, thus, normal. Its been quite some time since I had that much wine - and it wasn't even all that much! I guess we've got to get into ""condition"" before Canadameet though! ;) So now Adam and I are thinking of doing something for the long weekend in August - but we're not sure just what yet. Maybe camping? We might just go back to Sullivan Lake or maybe do something else. Suggestions anyone? It has to be something close to here as we're trying to save $$ to renovate our upstairs bathroom. But now I must get ready for work... Ciao!"
doc00038,4,"i just read in my urlLink friend larry's blog about some program that people are apparently submitting to where you skip airport lines and avoid delays by agreeing to have a background check, iris scan, and fingerprints on file. if you ask me, the delays are a small price to pay for keeping urlLink the man outta my eyeballs. i mean, is that scary or what? maybe it's just me, but i'm not down with that. speaking of scary, what's with all these horror films lately? that one ""the village"" looks particularly terrifying to me. it's like i have to see it even though i hate scary movies. i want to know what happens because on some level in my crazy brain i'm thinking if i know about this sort of thing then if it happens in real life i'll be able to protect myself from it. but then i'm scared for like 5 or 6 days afterward and i just add another strange phobia to my list. on my trip the only city where i had my own room was memphis and i woke up and i thought i saw an old slave woman with a bandana sleeping in the empty bed next to me. okay, that's crazy. i know. but i couldn't go to sleep until i had removed all the blankets and pillows from the bed. see! this is a perfect example of why i shouldn't be exposed to scary things. i am thinking of writing something entitled ""the haters' blog"" where i just hate on people and things i don't like. but then i thought that though hilarious, it would make me sort of sad that i had the time on my hands to devote to that. make no mistake, i could make a fulltime occupation out of hating on people, but i am trying to cut down. i really am. i'm trying to at least stop vocalizing the hate. that way, eventually if i stop saying the stuff i'll stop thinking it as often. right now i am listening to light rock. bonnie raitt. i wanna sing along so badly, but somehow people aren't down with that at work. i need a door on my office. okay, i'm starting to ramble out of control now so i'm going to stop writing. i wish i was more cohesive. i can't help the person i am though. gotta love me."

doc00040,3,"Almost everyone showed up at Kylie's house on Friday evening for a get-together to talk about our week. Robert, Ali, Terry and Mauricio didn't come, and of course, Lee is fishing in Alaska. It was *great* to see everyone! I tried to connect with almost everyone to talk about our experiences, or lack thereof. First off, I must say how sorry I am for Wendee, Stephen, Lynn and Dave M. They do not have a placement yet and are being bounced around schools and classrooms and are feeling very disgruntled about the whole PP process. I truly wish that they were having the experiences that I am having. I felt so bad for Wendee. I was telling her about our first day at CLP, how the new principal showed us around and how we had so many teachers come up and introduce themselves, and Wendee began to tear up. She has been sent to classroom after classroom and has even been told straight out, ""I don't want you here!"" Nobody will talk with her and she leaves her campus for lunch. Stephen has had some similar experiences. I think that all of them are feeling very unwanted at this point. I am thinking positive thoughts for all of the four of them. I hope that they get a placement soon! It was great hearing the stories from the others that have been in schools this week. The people in Loveland schools and Jeff at Pioneer School have not had any kids yet, but the rest of us have been in classes since Wednesday. I really like Sara's story about getting an apple from a student after she helped the little girl open her locker on the first day. It sounds like Tim is picking up some nice teaching skills in his Crafts class. Wendee, even though she is not firmly placed yet, has managed to learn abit about the underground Japanese Goth culture and Abby is teaching the boys in her French class how to kiss each other. It sounds like there are a number of cooperating teachers, however, that are pretty strict about their classroom and aren't giving PP students as much of a chance to participate and contribute as I have had. After listening to everyone's stories, I realize how incredibly lucky I am to be at CLP. The school and its staff have bent over backward to make me (and Jay) feel welcome. I truly feel that Mr. Jewett, my cooperating teacher, is glad to have me there and is anxious for me to help him in his classes in any way that I can. He is also very willing to let me try new things, conduct new projects and take over the class whenever it is needed. So far, my experience has been wonderful and I am truly grateful to be at a school where I feel that I belong. I have learned a few things in my first week. I will list them later."
doc00041,3,"Deep philosophical questions have been entering my brain concerning the topic of creation of human beings. The age old question is one that I choose to tackle before your very eyes. The meaning of life?! I sat there today as I wrote the science exam and I found myself thinking about a blog comment in particular made by the right honourable Christopher Martin. He mentioned something about math being something that doesn't apply to real life. Lisa Munro made a suggestion that math is 100% on paper and does not exist otherwise. This brings me to ponder the point of our existence: Are we only existing on paper? I feel like there are two identities placed on a person. That person's physical entity is the first, but the second is much more intriguing - that person's existence in papers and on records. The world is built on a trust system. Are we put on this Earth to exist as members of society? This is what the papers that define us lead us to believe. There is the other point that we might be meant to be living . Sometimes it seems like the right thing to revert to a more natural lifestyle among trees - to abandon what modern society has become. It makes it seem so much simpler, so much more correct . Any way you look at it, there is a real conflict of why we are here. Why are we living this? What would we be experiencing without life? Life is a miracle now? If there is an afterlife then what happens before life? These deep philosophical questions are probably what philosophy is based on. For now, it is my belief that all people are born from the womb. We all started out as cells but did not have the capacity of thought. We do not remember the state of being a fetus just as we do not remember the day of our birth. This is an issue where various facts of science have won my beliefs. You were a sperm once . There was no drama at that point in your life. Yes, that was your life. We are put on this earth to reproduce. If there was one thing I learned in biology it was the significance of population potential , or some other similar term. It means the ability of a population to reproduce. If there is a scale that judges how well we would be able to reproduce, then is that our reason to be on Earth? Is it to carry on the species? Hormones ensure that we are able to do so, but how we go about doing so is not something biology can control. If we cannot do so, have we failed to do what we were put here to do? You may ponder these points, but ponder also that we were all fetus at one point - probably at the same point. Whether or not we received enough milk was as important to us then as whether or not we succeed at being ""good"" teenagers now. In conclusion, science seems to not have abandoned us as teenagers. There are a number of philosophies that revolve around our reason to exist, but we must let them be for now and remember that we are all transmutations of an all-inclusive cheese."
doc00042,6,"OK today has marked the end of my 1st week back in NS. 6 days has passed. I now have 116 days left as of coming Monday. Countdown!! Err anyway, the week was quite uneventful. 1st day itself was the day reservists had to report to camp for a 1mth exercise, so naturally my precence was a low priority to my AS1 (manpower officer in charge). The interview and briefing was a quick one. Saw some of the old regulars who were still there. But it's quite sad, 2 of them are just waiting for the SAF to discharge them. All because they didn't pass their IPPT (hence no promotion coming). I guess some people didn't see fitness being such a serious aspect of their job feequirement when they signed on. It's not uncommon among many of the regulars I've seen, and I'm sure they won't be the last. I wasn't sure where I'm attached to so I basically reported to 2 'bosses' when I can. The SSG in charge of workshop and the brigade RSM. Currently I'm attached to the RSM at least for the duration for the month long exercise as his PA (personal assistant). He treats me quite well. 2 other guys have been temporarily attached to him prior to my arrival, Neo and William. Both nice friendly blokes. Neo is an MOE local scholar and William is a poly-grad from TP. Both are quite a funny combination during office hours. It seems like the RSM will be trying to retain me for the duration of my NS under his office but it's still too early to say if that's going to happen. I wouldn't know anyway, I'm just a foot-soldier. But I do hope that a good balance of work load is possible in office and workshop. I seriously want to try driving an M113 again. Tues was my first liferun in camp. It was an internal run by my own unit instead of a sister unit conducting it. Was a good slow pace for 4.5km. Wed work has basically started. Thurs was another life run, this time we joined our sister unit in camp for 5km. Being an infantry unit, the level of cohesiveness and spirit they have is simply admirable. They were actually cheering all the way. Fri things were quite busy, even for Thurs we extended our hours a bit beyond office hours but not by much. Sat was an outcamp run from Pasir Ris camp to Pasir Ris park. Originally I was just supposed to run 10km, but I met an officer I was attached under when I had just passed out from BMT a few years ago. He remembered my face but not much besides that. As I talked to him I kindly of went past the route I wanted to take and had to go for the 15km distance instead. My timing was an atrocious 2hr 2 min. But that included a lot of walking in between and I suffered quite a few cramps on both my calves. But considering that it was only my 3rd run and 1st long distance for a long time, it may still be acceptable. I hope I'll be able to improve before the Army Half Marathon on 14th Sep Sun. Didn't managed to get much work done today but will need to do some stuff from home to prepare for Mon. Sigh ... NS life."

doc00046,6,"The following input was received from a space geek in response to my Cassini consternation . Cassini didn't actually pass through the rings of Saturn during SOI. What it did was pass through the Ring Plane. That's pretty much unavoidable if you go past Saturn - even Voyager had to do it. Now the wackos at JPL did expect there to be some material in the ring plane, but 'minefield' is a bit of a misnomer - the average particle size in the ring plane is the size of a grain of smoke. Cassini registered 100,000 hits in the five minutes it took to cross it. 100,000 hits and it took it on the chin - what a manly space-probe that was."

doc00049,1,"MONDAY, FIRST DAY OF WEEK TWO!!! Which makes this Day Eight. We are having a big old celebration today, because I got through Week One with flying colors! Here's the count for WEEK ONE: calories consumed: 11,625 goal calories tppw: 9,121 goal calories oppw: 12,614 I am 2,511 calories over the goal for tppw. Therefore, I should have lost one pound, with 989 calories left over, which in a laboratory setting would equal another .28 of a pound. So about one and a quarter pounds. Therefore, I now weigh 258.75. Hee hee. This is hilarious, the whole thing is on paper (on electrons). I don't know what I weighed to start with or how much, if any, I really did lose. This seems to be an exercise in faith for me. I'm going to simply believe that it's working. It has to be that way at first anyway. A scale is not able to reliably detect whether I've lost a pound or not. There's too much fluctuation for that to register for real. It might say I'd lost 4 pounds, but 3 of that is water, not permanent. So we'll leave the scale alone for now. Back to today: overslept terribly. I didn't get up until 8; it's 8:38 now and I haven't even had breakfast yet. So exercise will be a little late today. I think I will tape Dr. Phil so I have that available in case Ellen is dull. Oh please let the glider arrive soon! Had a wonderful time with Daisy last night. I missed her SO much, and it broke my heart that she could go two weeks without me. I know that's silly, she's lived 32 years perfectly well without me. It's not that I want her dependent or clingy, I guess it just hurt my feelings (or maybe ego) a little. Anyway, she's back in town and we have grandiose ideas for our Plan 9 and how we're going to change our lives. So yay. And I'm on the Mac today; with Bucko back at work I can probably get access enough. That's nice. So, this week I'm going to start tracking water consumption. I want to drink 80 ounces a day. That's ten eight-ounce glasses. My water glasses are 12 ounces, so I need to drink 6.6 glasses, which I will round up to 7. I need to drink 7 glasses of water a day. I know I'm only drinking 3-4 glasses now. And in a random note: removing the skin from the chicken is definitely worth it. I LOVE the skin, but it adds so many calories, I can have a whole nother piece for the same amount. 11:29 a.m. Finished the hour exercise. Hard going! The first half hour was good, I worked really hard, but dragged the second part. Barely picking up my feet by the last quarter. Also I'm starving. I'm having more water now to fill up, because I don't want to eat until 12:30 or 1:00, since I am running behind. I don't want to be slave to the clock, but I'm trying to spread my meals out, so I don't eat my day's ""allotment"" in the first five hours. Really excited about Week Two. Bucko and I have once again resolved to limit ourselves to ""Drinking Nights,"" which are Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday. That will cut another 400 to 1000 calories from my weekly total. I like the way I'm treating this as an exact science, even though I don't actually know a) how much I weigh, b) how many calories I used to eat, c) how many calories I should eat, d) how many calories I'm burning in exercise, and e) my ass from a hole in the ground. 1:08 p.m. Delicious lunch of leftover chicken. I decided to have four pieces — two legs and two thighs — but didn't realize the plate had five pieces. When I sat down to eat it, I thought ""oh well, then I'll just have five."" Uh-uh. Hit the brakes on that one. I was so hungry I wanted to eat forever. But came to my senses and realized, I won't still be hungry after four pieces. I don't have to keep eating just because it's good. I mean, chicken isn't THAT good. So I ended up eating only three pieces. That's so much better, it leaves me room for a snack later and it was a good exercise in stopping in time. 2:27 p.m. Cleaning out the closet upstairs. What a mess! I'm trying to carry some of it out to the garage, but can't take too many trips up and down the stairs. Had a really strong craving for something sweet. Had an apple, that seems to have taken care of it. Doing well with the water too. I'm starting to track fiber also. I'm not sure it's as meaningful as if I also track the sugar part of the carbs, but I think this is as much of a chart as I can take. It's enough to give me a good picture and it's fun and interesting to maintain. Any more and I'll either lose interest or I'll focus too much on filling out a chart instead of living. 3:13. My tight jeans seem looser today than a few days ago. Hope that's a true sign. Feeling hungry again, and it's early in the day. I'm drinking more water. Going to get a little more exercise this afternoon, even if it's just packing. I don't want my metabolism to slow from eating less. 4:05 p.m. Taking down the blinds in the bathroom. Dusty! Also dull. I'll try to finish, but taking out all those screws by hand is killer. I got my water quota done today by 3:30. Good news, I won't be up peeing all night. Haven't planned dinner yet, but we have a little piece of salmon. I think the ribs are still frozen. Of course we can have a vegetable-intensive meal with just a tiny bit of fish. I can see I need to shop more often than usual, since we're not eating fast food anymore. I have 811 calories left for today. And I'm babbling again. 5:25 p.m. I can't believe how often I feel the need to ""check in"" here. It's just been my whole life for the past week, and I'll write any trivial nothing just to be writing and thinking about losing weight. Maybe that is what will make it work this time, maybe somehow I've developed the focus and interest to do it, and managed to set aside the resentment and onerousness. Because honestly, it pisses me off that I should ""have to"" lose weight. It pisses me off that people judge me, in all aspects of my character, based on this single physical attribute. I hate the societal pressure for women to lose weight to look good. It's one thing to lose for health, but as far as looks, hey go fuck yourself. Having salmon, steamed broccoli, and black bean salad for dinner. It will be a pretty big piece of salmon, around 8 ounces. Made a sauce/dip for the broccoli out of no-fat yogurt with about a tablespoon of gorgonzola cheese, ginger, and fresh ground pepper. It's not bad — the tanginess of the yogurt doesn't go with everything, but it's nice with most vegetables. The bean salad is a can of black beans, a can of ""Mexican"" diced tomatoes, and a handful of leftover lettuce. It's pretty and colorful, and has a wonderful texture."

Or mere tabbies that the guy is trying to bullshit me into believing (like anyone couldn�t tell the diff). I�ve wanted an Aby since I was a preteen. The Mau� I�d never heard of it until tonight. Best part? The guy is definitely family, and I think our mutual positions on that will benefit me."

So edit your choices for movies in here below. RESTRICTIONS are ars follows: *NO MUSICALS! (We're having a seperate JournalCon for them. So don't bring one.) *Nothing over 140 minutes in length. * NOTHING ON VHS! DVD ONLY. This is an absolute must. Ladies and Gentlemen, Pick Your Movies.

doc00061,5,"Mostly this week has been taken up with not drinking, eating healthy, trying to get a job I enjoy and can make decent money at and just trying to survive. I of course didn't get the T-Mobile job even though everyone went out of their way for me, having a DUI is just too much. God damn DUI. So instead of having a Job I like I don't have a job I like. I've been looking for more jobs though. Preferable in sales and not in a restaurant (god I'm sick of restaurants). So that's the way things are. School starts tomorrow and at that point I will probably disappear off the planet and this will probably be the only way to get ahold of me. 9 hours in a month. What was I thinking. oh but on a lighter side, saw 3 great movies this weekend. ""Love Actually,"" which was funny and sweet and just good on all sorts of levels. Would probably have been better if I watched it with a cute girl instead of my parents but it was still good. I also saw, ""Miracle"" which was good as any sports movie about underdogs that is done well is good. And I saw ""In America"" which was amazing and basically beyond words how good it was. If you want to know I cried through the whole thing and just was moved by everything in it. If you can sit through movies without explosions, I know some of you can't (Paul), then you will enjoy this movie. So I'm off to achieve a few more goals today and see if I can actually succeed at anything without someone dropping the hammer on me."

It brought to mind these two quotes: 'If cars had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon, and once a week exploded, killing everybody inside.' 'What kind of a world would it be if you got up, had breakfast, got dressed, did up your shoelaces the normal way, and they refused to work? If your shoelaces just wouldn't tie up?'"

doc00065,4,I believe our blog is falling into the trap that many succumb too: that of becoming too serious and philosophical. We are starting to lose our sheer stupidity and we haven't mentioned Aardvarks for at least 2 blogs. We are on the slippery slope to becoming another mundane blogspot. After my well thought out analasis of our condition i will now try to combat it with a post of sheer stupidity and randomness. I really have built this up so I will try not to make this an anticlimax. Ahem... Words fail me. Oh I know. A joke i invented: What do you call a constipated cow? A cow. Geddit? oh well never mind. Isn't it ironic that people in prison always seem to win the lottery. If i did the lottery i would commit a minor offence (such as killing Edwina) then the chances of me winning would be much higher. But i don't do the lottery anyway so there goes that plan. I've gotta go to London tomorrow for the whole weekend. :( I really don't want to go as I have to go to the British Museum. But there's more chance of Shelbourne drawing with Deportivo La Coruna than me being allowed to stay. Hmmm looks like i'll have to put my stupidity into another post. If stupidity was a mouse then this post is a cheesecake.
doc00066,3,"Tear jerker... Co sent me this great story she got sent to her, and I just had to share. I wasn't going to blog this am, but I am having a little trouble getting up for another day at my present job, soon, very soon, things will be better because I chose to do something about it instead of being depressed about it. This story hit home hard today as I have had to make some tough choices and I just got done with an email trying to help a young tranny who is having trouble with stuff. I am not giving the rah, rah, life as a tranny is great speech. We are not Jehova's witnesses looking to save some souls, we are trying to make it with a not so great hand in life. I have been explaining the need for strength, how she will loose allot, and it will get harder before it gets better. I hope she listens, she as the same age as I was when I tried to transition about 15 years ago, not an easy task. Oh well the story, hope it touches you too. Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, would reply, ""If I were any better, I would be twins!"" He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation. Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Michael and asked him, ""I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?"" Michael replied, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or ... you can choose to be in a bad mood. I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or ... I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or... I can point out the positive side of life. Choose the positive side of life. ""Yeah, right, it's not that easy,"" I protested. ""Yes, it is,"" Michael said. ""Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live your life."" I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the Tower Industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it. Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back. I saw Michael about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied. ""If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"" I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place. ""The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon to be born daughter,"" Michael replied. ""Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or ... I could choose to die. I chose to live."" ""Weren't you scared? Did you lose\ consciousness?"" I asked. Michael continued, ""...the paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, I read ""he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take action."" ""What did you do?"" I asked. ""Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me,"" said Michael. ""She asked if I was allergic to anything. ""Yes, I replied."" The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, ""Gravity."" Over their laughter, I told them, ""I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead."" ""Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully. Attitude, after all, is everything. ""Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."" After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. If you wish to fight the world, then choose to fight it strongly, and with dignity, and don't let it destroy you in the process. -Ashley urlLink postCount('108315743286815196'); | urlLink postCountTB('108315743286815196');"

doc00069,4,"Boy oh boy! Two quick points of note on this fine fine day. The first is that I just read an archived report about a fellow I am to be the best man of next year. Seems that in order to protest some poorly-managed energy measure his school proposed, the boy sat outside, WITHOUT showering. This even went on to include the folks from the Guiness book of records to get him on file as the person who went the longest without a shower. Clever indeed. I hope those folks at the school took notice...and I am glad to see his fiancee got him to change his ways. Yick! I get the rudest crotch-funk after just 1 day without showering. I think this guy went like 600 days. But don't worry Frankie, ol' buddy ol' pal....as your best man, I will INSIST you take a shower at least a month before walking down the aisle. On another note, I was able to use my beat old laptop for the first time in what seemed like a year or so. It was on loan to my company, and well out of my hands. I used it to hop over to this whack old Southside bar. It is really neat, as it has this great fireplace, stained glass and wainscoating. It also happens to be in a GODDAMN strip mall. WTF?!?! Well... I got a great recording of this swell jam-band. Glad to see I still have it together. Ughh... There was one misfortune.

doc00071,4,"Let me start the second part of this long, long night with a song, because it IS going to be long, already. Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls And I'd give up forever to touch you Cuz I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't wanna go home right now And I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life And sooner or later it's over I just don't wanna miss you tonight And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive And I don't want to world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am (interlude) And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I was thinking of this song because of a few things: I started thinking about Zoe's Blurty, and in that you can be affiliated with certain groups of common interests. One of them was for cutting and understand why they do it, and also to help them get over it. There were a few quotes from songs in there that relate to it, and one of them was: Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive . So I thought about that. Then today, I was taking a nap and I remembered it and resolved to post it here. It sounds just like me. I used to realllllllllllyyyyyy like the Goo Goo Dolls, I haven't listened to them in a while though. I guess I'll be picking that one back up soon. Iris shall be on Poor Bastard Vol. 2 (and yes, the first one's official title is Poor Bastard Vol. 1, Aug 2002 - Jan 2003, the list is a little different since Tinblogged got deleted and that was the only place I put it). And now to the pressing matter. It seems that one of Kenzie's friends wants to go out with me. I brought it up with Leigh Anne and she was like, ""Well at least it'll get you off my back,"" and I said, ""Oh no, you can't shake me that easy,"" and she was like, ""Damn,"". Ok. But the thing is, it was really half-hearted, to the point where even I could take it that way, and second, when she's trying to shake me off, she'll use the phrase, ""Just move on,"". I need some interpretations, by the way: ""It's going to be really funny when you find out you don't care about me."" and ""You lied; you said you loved me."" Actually, I know what they both are quintessentially, ""I want attention"", the Leigh Anne fling. It's amazing how desperately she needs it. But right now she's talking to Brittany, and Brittany has a lot of sway over her, whether she'd like to admit it or not. It's going to be a long night. This would've been longer had she not called back just now. ARGH. I'm weird, but my shirt smells really good right now. HeeHAW."

I just can't do the song all together because I'm not that coordinated/patient. Most songs I play that are complicated (i.e.: Blackened ) require more fretboard work than actual picking. And that is really gay. Pianos are bigoted to right-handed people and that is so uncool...Abby's just really special, that's all. Whereas I have been playing for the last thirty minutes, getting absolutely nowhere...but I did wake up this morning and remember, as a matter of fact, how to play Blackened from a few years ago, when I was heavily into Metallica's ...And Justice For All . I just stood up, checked the message, read some more Harry Potter (which I finished....what a sad and miserable ending...), and then stood up to find ALL OF MY GEAR IN PERFECT SHAPE, SOMEHOW... it fixed itself...and so I played Blackened at a much higher level than I should've, along with the solos to Master of Puppets , Sanitarium (and a bit of the song with it), My Friend of Misery , ...And Justice For All , and some others.

Sad, yes, but true. I thought the theory was only applicable in the Buffalo area, but apparently it works in the Southtowns as well. I'm almost positive it works on Transit.

doc00086,4,"Okay...I'm going to admit something that I'm not terribly happy about. When I was living in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, there was an anchorwoman named Bree Walker , who had deformed hands, that my friends and I used to make fun of all the time. I remember one of my friends came up with the nickname of ""stumpy"" for her and we'd laugh and laugh and laugh. As the story goes, though, when you get older, you become more sophisticated in the way you view things. So, being what I hope is a more enlightened person, I'd like to think that I would be much more sensitive about the matter. Anyway, the reason why I bring this up is because Bree Walker was on urlLink Larry King Live tonight (or, actually, it was an encore presentation, but this is the first time I had seen it). To tell you the truth, I actually had forgotten about Walker until now and, sadly, I remember hearing her name and the first thought popping into my mind being ""stumpy."" Walker, who has a genetic deformity called ectrodactyly, was on the show to talk about her activism in terms of disability. I decided to watch the show to hear what she had to say and I was really impressed with what she had to say, particularly when talking about issues of abortion, widening what we traditionally call ""diversity,"" and stem cell research. King questioned Walker about a controversy surrounding a KFI radio reporter who had called Walker out on bringing a child into the world knowing there's a possibility the child could also be born with ectrodactyly: KING: And what did they ask you to do, those who were against you having the baby? WALKER: Most people felt that I should have chosen abortion. And in fact, when I had gone to my ob/gyn in New York at Mt. Sinai Hospital. I was sent up to the chief ob/gyn to have a conversation after we saw that my first child, Andrea, who's now almost 16 in a sonogram did, in fact have my hands and feet. And I saw it. I saw her little hands and feet pushed up against the uterine wall, and I said, ""She's got my hands and feet."" And at that time, the sonogram operator ran outside, left -- leaving me there lying with just the sheet and then the chief of obstetrics came down to speak with me. And he said, ""Please come up to my office."" At which point, he said, ""Here are the options."" And I looked at him, thinking, ""This is an automatic conversation that the medical community and social science community had with women that have disabilities that are congenital. There is an automatic conversation that you're going to be expected to choose abortion."" KING: You never thought of it? WALKER: Of course I thought of it. I mean, I'm someone who believes that a woman's right to her own body -- body is a supreme thing. It's interesting listening to a woman who has the option to decide whether she wants to have an abortion or not. Ultimately, she chooses not to have an abortion, but she clearly states that it is a decision that is hers to make on her own without intrusion from outside forces. Later, Walker talked about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): WALKER: Well, we live in a time, luckily, when as of 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. But as time has marched on, a lot of that ADA has been gutted. So we're living in a time now when, as you know, our popular culture has become pretty toxic for young women and for aging women. It's the same toxic problem. As the bar continues to be raised on what is physical perfection and a more narrower definition is given us, what's acceptable, we have an impossible standard. And we're forced to focus on superficial values. That hurts the disability rights movement, because of course this kind of diversity isn't celebrated when you're living in a culture that worships only the pursuit of physical perfection. I'm ashamed to say that I never thought of deformity and disability as part of the diversity spectrum. Sometimes, I get so focused on diversity as a racial issue or a sexual orientation issue that I forget the spectrum is much wider than we even imagine it. I appreciate people who continue to challenge our notions of diversity. As Walker explains, ""It is the last civil rights movement. There are about 50 million people that fall under a category of officially disabled in the ADA, in various clarifications, which means one in five."" But, what was even more interesting was Walker talking about stem cell research as it could potentially help end ectrodactyly. Walker is quick to laud and support the coming of stem cell research but maintains that deformity is a part of our reality: WALKER: I think ultimately we will genetically engineer most disabilities and deformities out of our culture. I'm all for getting rid of diseases that reduce the quality of life. I don't want to decide anything for my kids. I think they will be faced with the decision of do we engineer this out of their futures? I don't know what they'll choose. We don't discuss it too much, other than to say this will probably be a possibility within their lifetime. I think, however, it's important to remember that diversity is what makes human beings so interesting. And who's to say that, as we become more alike, genetically engineered to be all blue-eyed or brown-eyed or X number of girls versus X number of boys in the world, who is to say that we don't so challenge what is important in humanity that we've ruined everything? Again, she points out our society's emphasis on physical perfection. After seeing her on Larry King Live tonight, I gain not only more respect for Bree Walker, but for those who have to live with disability or deformity. While it's probably not likely Ms. Walker reads this entry, I leave an open apology for the things I thought about in the past about a woman who I think young women everywhere should aspire to be."

I realize I may be one of the few librarians into fantasy football, but I can't help it. It makes football games so much more interesting when I am rooting for players.

doc00091,3,"My poor blog, neglected for so long! I am back home now, and I picked Chancey up from the kennel this morning. He seems to have faired very well there, which is wonderful. Now maybe we won't have to worry so much about leaving him next time we go away. I have a list of about a million things to do today, but so far it's pretty slow going. I am about to head out to Target to pick up a few things--hopefully I'll have the skills to install towel racks on the back of our bathroom door when I get back. Nothing hugely ambitious. I'm still getting used to how quiet it is here, compared to in Elkton. Enjoying some much-needed time alone, too. Mom's surgery went well, draining as it was. We are hoping for the best as far as results, but it's too early to really be able to tell. She seems pretty optimistic, though. It felt like I wasn't in Elkton for long enough. Anxious as I was to get back home and especially to pick up Chance, I wasn't really ready to leave. Strange how that works. I think Mark is ready to come home, though, even though he's only been in Minnesota a few days. I talked to him a bit ago and he didn't sound particularly as if he was having a good time. Blah.

I was surfing few days ago, looking at what kind of courses, qualification I can do. By the end of that day, I selected BSc of Psychology and Dip. of Physiotherapy. After hearing my sis' opinion, I feel Physiotherapy will help me find my passion. As some might know, I'm really keen on Bio Science. *wink* I contacted the incharge at NYP on the Dip of Physiotherapy. The min requirement is ""A"" and even thou I've a BSc, I am lack of Bio background. He informed me of an accelerated program at the Nursing dept which is suitable for ""pple like me"". It is very subsidised and I can receive allowance throughout the 2 yrs course. At the end of the course, I'll be 'employed' by a local hospital. (Bonded I believe). Nursing was what I've been thinking but family members are against it. And i don't think I am up for the 12-hours shift either. Haha. However it has a lot of avenues that you can specialise in. Physiotherapy really sound good to me. Even if I want to try NYP (for 3 yrs), I'll have wait until I finish my 2 yrs bond with EDB (i'll be 27-8). By the time I can practise physiotherapy, I'll be 30 - 31. If I choose this path, I'll want to go towards research and eventually PhD. OMG, then I can stop speculating if I'll ever get married. Hahhaa. This path will be putting my 7-8 yrs of Comp Sci to waste. All that money, time and sleepless nights put to waste. Alternatively, I can go oversea again and pursue a Deg in Physiotherapy. And move on to Masters and PhD. But where to find sponsors? Where is my golden tortise?? So for the time being, I'm stucked with my contract. Maybe I'll take up a part time job to save up for further studies. Maybe I'll look at what part time Masters I can take, but that might be a waste of money if it's not put into use. Maybe I'll think about what business I can do and look for investors. *wink wink* The paper chase is so tiring."

Still chemical foci, as Pobs uses, just going about it's business in roads. Chase will take Pob's avatar energy with him via the Cor foci, showing him distance and spacial relatives. Then, the prime kicker will activate, and we'll send over plasma bolts into his fuckin' brain."" Cassius says ""17 total... hmm, minus the four... carry the 87... comes out to about... 26 health levels."" Pobble sits back, chews and repeatedly drags on an unlit cigarette. The repetition seems to calm him and he stares off into the distance, with an expression that seems to be slowly melting. The monkey on his lap looks up at him with sad blue eyes, holding onto one of his hands and gently poking at the holes in his hands, as if trying to remind the missing Deity of where to go to unleash its holy wrath on the crossfucking nonbeliever. This is the zone Chase was telling you about. Static hissing in the background, meth-sulfate mix hitting your spine. The thick man's in his plush chair in much the same spell Pobs is. Some sweat beading upon his shaved scalp and gum chewing to some internal clockwise beat. Every five point seven seconds, he remembers to breath and blink all at once. Veins straining on his horse neck,he finally blows a bubble. *POP* ""You feel, it eh. Como que no. Dios."" A single bead of sweat drips from Pobble's nose onto the monkey who scratches at his head and goes to say something but thinks the better of it. Something in the air causes its fur to bristle just a touch and an expectant grin begins to form on its lips. The smell of paradox on the wind, the smell of the mother of all highs. ""Indubidably."" murmers the good Doctor, silver fingernails glinting as he continues the motion with precise timing. Sucking the cigarette, sucking the essence of Yahwe back to his oh so hollow skull and a non lonely place. Angsty longing for the missing godhead causes a twitch on his lip between drags, but it vanishes, succumbing to a merry sigh and a moment with closed eyes. Twitches start, like a cink in the system, one of Chase's lazy eyes squints up and releases. ""Yeah. Fuckin' yeah."" Chin up when he looks to the skies, obscured by layers of earth, concrete and mortar. ""I just keep chewing."" To nothing in particular as callused hands shake up a glass vile containing reddish liquid. He inserts it into an air injection unit and raises it behind his ear. ""Grounded kicker. It's the universe's spike, cabrone."" The unit bites his skin with a hiss. ""Dave gotta stay with me next week....p... pu.... puto."" Chase let's out a whisper. A lighter is drawn from somewhere, its chrome muddied with blood from Steve's hand. He has 'em and he'll smoke em. Eyes that would be bloodshot if they weren't purest white flutter and the man lets out a sigh as he exhales that first sweet drag. ""I'm not heading anyplace anytime soon fucker. Not safe outside by my reakoning."" Absently Chase hands over the kicker, still some red fluid to inject. ""Hit that. Main line it, cabrone. We'll get... we'll get... the rest a you lot over..."" Starting to get woozy, eyes close. His other nostril starts bleeding. Wether its the sound of his name, or that scent in the air.. Dave scampers back and forth on the Dr's lap. The monkey takes the shot and injects the willing Dr, then suckles at the wound briefly. Its electrifying, the Monkey falling back onto the floor with a thump where he starts convulsing and shaking with the grin of one who is terrifyingly euphoric."

Is this really generating enough revenue to help the deficit or just the DC area? Another big question, will another president, currently living, get this kind of fanfare when they die? I doubt it. News even mentioned that we haven't done this since Lyndon Johnson. Why is that?! Does a president have to have some building or room named after them to get this kind of recognition when dead? Fuck that! Maybe they should honor Reagan by not having political commercials for the entire week or so until he's buried. I could live with that. On for more fun news and other good stuff. This is a bit self titled cause I can. hehe Here's another rampage, you are now warned. What is with self titled music albums? Are they supposed to be incites into the person? Incites on what is going on with them about 6 to 9 months ago? I'm curious but then again if you've gotten this far, you would have gathered that by now. :) Should also have gathered that I question just about everything too. Sometimes I also notice the little stuff and question that too. I feel questions give incite into the person asking and answering. Some ask questions just to have those same questions asked back. OK I am guilty of that as well. Eh, I'm human, deal with it. Now for the tough question: On your list of resolutions, how many, if any, have you started, finished or completed by now?

I have so many things to do and no time to do them. I'm going crazy! And since I'm leaving this weekend I am missing a bunch of stuff at church. I'm kinda worried about the sound room too 'cause the guys that were supposed to do it forgot they were this weekend and were planning on going camping... so they kinda weren't prepared.

doc00125,1,"urlLink Woman Fired For Eating 'Unclean' Meat In a nutshell, a woman gets hired at a telecommunications company in Florida. This company is headed by people of the Muslim faith. Now, the woman ate lunch in the cafeteria at this workplace that had pork in it, a BLT sandwich. She was fired because she violated the company's unwritten rule stating that pork (a taboo among Muslims) is not to be located anywhere on the premises. Now, the boss stated that the company did not descriminate against this woman for her religious beliefs. They told her that they didn't care what her religious background was when they hired her. He stated that the company is sensitive to everyone's religious beliefs...so, this woman was not allowed to eat pork. If you were a follower of Islam and a guy sitting next to you was eating a delicious ham sandwich, is it acceptable to tell that person to not eat that sandwich near you or not eat it at all? Do you have the right to restrict someone else's diet because it does not adhere to your religious beliefs? Does an employer have the right, in an American business, a country which has laws of equal opportunity employment, to restrict ones own diet because it does not adhere to the employer's personal religious beliefs? I believe that the answer to all of those questions is a big, fat, juicy, greasy, ham-flavored NO . If this employer was trying to be sensitive to others religious beliefs, why not state rules in this workplace that would adhere to other religions. Catholocism : No meat on Fridays during Lent. You also have your Catholics who follow this rule all-year around, you know, for some extra godliness. Judiaism : Meat accepted that comes from animals with cloven hooves (cows, sheep, goats, deer). Pork is forbidden. Khasis Society : Animists and spirit worshippers of S.E. Asia follow a milk taboo. They can't drink milk from a goat or a cow."

A poet that I've never met wants to move to Jersey and live with me. After none of my friends, family, or girlfriends would. Not that I asked anyone to move. But I didn't have to ask this guy either. ""It'll be like free grad school,"" he said. ""Except we won't get a degree!"" I love the idea. He's written quite a bit on rice pudding. I may have to include some of it in the next post.

Here's a quick, male perspective on The Boy From Oz. Unless you or your significant other has a thing for Hugh Jackman, skip it. It's 3 hours long, and all Hugh. He's fascinating to watch, because you keep thinking about Wolverine (The Canadian mutant loner from the comic book X-men with the Adantium claws and skeletal structure). But the novelty of a singing, dancing, gay comic book hero wears off after the first hour. The story of Peter Allen is interesting, but I don't think it warranted a full blown musical. And the story was so broad (covering from the time he was 6 until his death), that a lot of the more dramatic scenes were glossed over. A whole musical could have been written about his marriage, or about meeting Judy Garland in Hong Kong, or losing the people he cared about to AIDS. But whoever wrote it obviously wasn't interested in conflict. It's a feel-good, watch the man-candy dance, kind of thing. A little focus would have gone a long way."

doc00129,3,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World This movie was surprisingly better than I expected it to be. It's a big-budget Hollywood epic, there is no doubt about that, but the acting and dialogue aren't as bad as they could be (note that I am *not* saying they are good, just that they aren't as bad as they could be) and the special effects are great. When they sail through bad weather, you get sick to your stomach. Plus there is just something inherently cool about big old boats. It also manages to meet most of my criteria for a decent period film. The cast never really looks clean, and they wear the same clothes over and over. They also keep fake accents to a minimum and don't try to overdo the ""period speak"" (althought they do a fairly irritating job of calling each other ""Mr. Lastname"" instead of by first name, which I don't quite buy). The medicine is grisly (if fairly unbelievable). The ships quarters seem larger than I would expect, but I guess you have to sacrifice some accuracy in the name of cinema. I have never pretended to like Russell Crowe. I make no bones about it, I think he's a pompous ass and I don't think he has any acting chops whatsoever. That being said, he didn't irritate me half as much in this film as he did in Gladiator (and yes, I think Gladiator is one of the worst movies every made). And Joaquin Phoenix isn't in this either, so that helps. Billy Boyd, the guy who plays Merry in LOTR, has a smallish part, though, and he's awesome. I also liked Paul Bettany as Crowe's doctor friend, which isn't surprising since I got such a kick out of him in The Knight's Tale (which is, nonetheless, a truly terrible film). This film has no women in it. It's hard to tell the minor characters apart because everyone is grubby and dressed the same and talks the same and nobody has a first name. It's l-o-n-g. All in all, though, it's one of those things that is worth $8 to see on the big screen, if you get the chance. If you don't, don't bother renting it."
doc00130,3,"- wedding description - epistemological coup - janson's dissertation - more ohio dissing Well, the wedding is over. Everything was beautiful. Laura and Erik’s SMILES gave me such joy that I started crying with inspiration / worship / happiness as I prayed with them after the lighting of the Unity Candle. Their joy in each other was a beautiful mirror of the love God has for us. BERlin was great – and when I re-read my last blog – I realized that I sounded much more anti-Ohio than I am or wanted to seem. I love Ohioans. Possibly I have more dear-friend-Ohioans than (could this be true, Michiganders?) any other state. Ohio has been good to me. I feel grateful for what I have gained here. Berlin was great – despite its hardcore disneyfication of the amish (for you far-awayers – Holmes County, Ohio is one of the top three spots for Amish-tourism in the world)– because somehow, between all the stylization, the pace and the peace of the surrounding countryside and the centuries of tradition just FEEL like they pool around you slowing things down a bit. Laura’s dad, Paul graciously had us stay in a hotel with the kids where Jaelyn swam a good twenty feet (all at once!) under water. I have a keen sense that such news (look at my honor roll student! bumper sticker news) should be edited out of the blog in general, but twenty feet! Gosh! I preached on First John 4. I liked the stuff I came up with -- can't comment on how it was received. My core reading of I john 4 -- knowledge of the Divine comes only through embodied love of those around us -- i think is a radical epistemological coup, but i tried to steer clear of such terminology... Lynn and I are sitting in our living room waiting for Janson and Heather to arrive. Jans, most of you know, is our still-in-school-since-we-graduated-college-together-11-years-ago-seminarian-friend who is dissertating on the book of NUMBERS – and its literary value. Isn’t that great?! The most demonized book by Christians – who – see – no – point – in – the – last – in – the – last – half – of – the – Pentateuch…and Janson suggests that the key to understanding the whole of scripture is right there in Numbers 1 – 10. We always feel so deepened and motivated by listening to the ideas he's wrestling with. We’re meeting Heather for the first time, just after she’s finished meeting his sister and he’s meeting her sister for the first time (what a weekend!). Then they’re driving back to Chicagoland tomorrow after church. Hmmm. I’m not really blogging about any of the ideas / issues that are on my figurative ""back burner"", so if, on the off chance that you’re reading for issue-centered narrative, forgive this purely event centered blog. Oh wait – before I go - one more Ohio-diss. On the way to Berlin we drove through Justus. Now when you say Justus, Ohio – it sounds a lot like Justice – but, I always rant as I drive through (how downright intolerant and non-Buberian of me, this is), Just – US is a much more apt way of describing the outlook of the smalltown folk of the world. Sure we’ll put a sign up announcing the name of our town – and while we’re announcing the name, perhaps we could try to chase away foreigners – we’ll name our town Just Us. And if that weren’t enough the high school in town: Fairless High School. Just to be fair – if it were named Fairness high school, I’d have a joke, too, but please, I can’t let that connection go unrecognized – a town called Just Us and a high school named Fairless? It’s like these people are the home of the villain in a comic book devoted to a superhero whose greatest attribute is her commitment to Justice – this little town is the yang to her yin. BTW ~ the two people I know who TEACH at Fairless ~ Rachel & Ben are anything but fairless. They’re wonderful teachers. So (!) devoted. By this time Jans and Heather arrived, we talked for hours, slept for a few and it’s a beautiful Sunday morning. The kids will wake any minute and we’ll start to get ready for church...so for now... peace~"

It's just a beautiful hymn unlike... Well, Velle, here's the link to God Defend New Zealand, complete with lyrics, score and a few downloadable variations of the anthem. urlLink New Zealand National Anthems (Yes, there are two: the other one is God Save the Queen.) Which brings me to the fateful match. Met up with Christine, Lydia and Nicholas for dinner, then proceeded to Federation Square. The place was buzzing. We saw Joanne with a friend of hers. Ming and Adrian Loo turned up, with a few of Adrian's friends. Found out another friend, another Lydia, was watching the game at Fed Sq too. Most people stood up for both National Anthems. The Haka was performed with particular ferocity. Where the ferocity went once the whistle blew is something only the All Blacks can answer. I'm lucky I'm not a Kiwi. The New Zealanders are going to wake up tomorrow with more than bruised egos, and the team, with more than bruised bodies. Australia did what they haven't been doing the whole tournament: getting the basics right. The only hint of unforced errors came from Mat Rogers almost at the end. Trust me, the guy, together with Wendell Sailor, are the weak links in the Wallabies defence. Put them under pressure and see them crumble. Unfortunately, the All Blacks couldn't put pressure on them. But that's because they couldn't get their hands on the ball, especially in the first quarter of the game. But that, arguably (and circuitously) was because they weren't putting pressure on the Oz forwards. But the boys in gold were determined. I remember the look on Gregan's face when Kelleher put his hands in the ruck. His veins were pumped, and Gregan let Kelleher know how stupid he was for making the error. Nevermind, I still support the All Blacks. And there's England. The last thing I want to see is an Australia-France final. I might not even watch the final if that happens. I'm still traumatised by the game and the outcome. *sigh* Really disappointed. Celine, I feel your pain. For me, I hope it won't be compounded tomorrow night.

doc00148,2,"This weekend, I also found time to read Jack Finney's 1954 novel, The Body Snatchers, the basis for two movies that I know of. It was a crisply-written, well-paced book that reminded me a lot of works by Richard Matheson and John Wyndham. It has Wyndham's sense of a familiar community being overrrun by horrific events, what Brian Aldiss called the 'cozy catastrophe', and the element of a larger comment being made about an aspect of the human condition within a pulp-sf format that I associate with Matheson's 'I Am Legend' and 'The Shrinking Man'. In this case, the novel can be seen on some level as a depiction of the increasing alienation of modern life, and a dramatisation of the horror of it all. Unlike the more recent movie version, however, the story ends on a positive note, with the ominous pod-people proving to be no match for simple human ingenuity. Leaving all that aside, it's simply a good yarn, well told. The style is restrained and lucid, and the plot is largely tight and well-knit, apart from a couple of glitches here and there."
doc00149,4,"The Shocker (The amazing things we learn from the Internet ) Follow this simple procedure: Start with your outstretched hand, palm up. Take your ring finger and touch it to your thumb. Flatten your finger and thumb a bit, while your first, second and pinky fingers remain straight up. Rotate your hand a little, so your straightened fingers are pointing somewhat sideways. Congratulations, you have just made ""The Shocker"". It is a gesture meant to indicate a sexual act, wherein the first and second fingers enter a vagina, while the errant pinky plunges into the anus; hence the ""shock"". The gesture has taken on other, more explicit names like ""Two in the pink and one in the stink"" and ""Two in the coot and one in the boot"". So, the next time you want to express your loathing for someone, you can try giving him the ""shocker"" instead of the usual ""finger"" gesture."
doc00150,1,"Here I sit , a broken man , Because the pieces of me just don’t fit , even though ive done all I can, And my head just spins in violent circles , I don’t do shit , though I know I can. Here I am , a waste of space, Like spoiled spam, an ugly face, And I cant seem to do anything correctly, This life : a sham ,this sham : a disgrace. Here I stay , in an illusion of my past, Where I run away , but reality catches up real fast , And I weaken at the very thought of coping , This , and everyday, my soul is harassed. Here I fucking stagnate , and I know you’ve heard it all before , Taken all I can take, why would any human be expected to take any more? , And I know my choice is my damnation , So I dwell in a sad state , somewhere between the outside world and the front door. Here I scream a shattering whisper of pain, my doubts are confirmed when noone hears a sound, So I choose not to go, but to stay, insane, allowing the truncated trith to leave me where I was found, And I hate my damnation but it is all I have, Even the grand price I pay , at least gives me some feeling of something profound. Here I die and am reborn into change, I reinvent the misery that noone sees and still you all look on with question marks, My picture in the dictionary, under the word strange, yet I wouldn’t produce light if I shit out sparks, And I long still to be loved,,,,,why? So I can be the dog with scurvey and mange , at the pound as you all pass me by ignoring my horrible barks. Here I sit and write this tripe, feeling sad and lonely enough to cry to myself but I don’t want to hear it anymore, So Its either go hit the pipe, or sit and blubber like an infant until I wish to ball no more, And I choose one or the other but either will be the wrong one, Numb as I type, when I used to feel relief when I wrote, instead of getting more in touch with the rot at my core."

doc00156,1,"Today is Tuesday, a rather bland day of the week. There really is nothing new to write about so I will give a brief synopsis of some of the recent topics of interest that have some across my path. •Mystery Hill-America’s Stonehenge- This site is located in North Salem New Hampshire and consists of 30 acres of low walls and cave-life primitive buildings/tunnels along a hillside, as well as a “Sacrificial Stone” table that is believed to be used in the obvious. It has been found that this site has astrological alignments to the summer solstice. In 1823 the land and site was owned by Jonathan Patee. Some believe that some of the stones contain markings that resemble ancient Ogam writing. •John Moschos-6th century monk who wrote the Spiritual Meadow about his travels from Mt. Athose to Byzantine. He name is also spelled Ioannes Moschos meaning John the Calf. He was a good friend of Sophronios a patriarch of Jerusalem and was a sworn enemy of the monophysites. He began his journey in 587 A.D. and it lasted 30 years where he crossed Egypt, Palestine, the Levant and Anatolia. His book is an account of the disappearance of Christianity across the Middle East. •Skellig Michael- Located 12 km off of Ireland’s west coast houses a 7th cent. Monastic complex of the first Irish Christians. The site is very well preserved due to the remoteness of the land and the treacherous journey to get to the island. The Clochans or beehive huts can be seen 2/3 up the face of the rock The monastery is now designated as a World Heritage Site. Irish monks in habited the site from 588-1222 AD. Skellig is a Gaelic word used to describe a rock island in the ocean. The island is named after the Archangel Michael. The monastery was founded by Fionan-one of the original monks who was a member of the community of St Brendan the Navigator. (I will be reading Sundance soon which is about Skellig Michael) •Sufi/Sufism-in Arabic called “tasawwuf”, understood to be the inner, mystical or psycho-spiritual dimension of Islam. The practice involves the Sufi surrendering to God in love and embracing with each moment the content of one’s consciousness-thoughts, emotions and sense of self as gifts or manifestations of God. Also stated to be the name that Islamic mysticism was know as in the 8th-9th cent. •Caucasus- Region in Eastern Europe and Western Asia between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, includes the Caucasus Mountains and surrounding lowlands. It is one of the most linguistically and culturally diverse places on earth. Some historical events that have taken place include the Arab-Khazar wars, conquest of the Caucasus by Russia. I would continue but I’ll put the other topics in my next installment so as not to further bore anybody. (Next installment will include the Esker Riada, The Turoe Stone, and Clonmacnoise among other topics). Michael thinks that I am strange for researching things that are interesting to me. I think he was comparing me to Cliff Claven from Cheers…oh well, I would rather be learned about a wide range of things than be walking the face of the world ignorant (I can’t help think of Michael Jackson when I hear/use that word, how sad) to our history and accomplishments as humans."

Somewhere behind my smiles lies a once-brokened heart and from time to time, when anyone (including myself) accidentally scrapes off the scabs before it heals completely, the wound tends to smart and bleed.

doc00166,1,"Many of you know that my life dealt with everything violent until I got locked up. Facing 60 years to life brings new perspective to your being. LOL Anyway, I was extremely knowledgable when it came down to one of my favorite pastimes; guns. Everything from field stripping to cleaning to shooting all types. Today my soul has been re-energized and quenched!! I headed with my boys Tom and Mike ( Collins brothers )to the wonderful state of Pa. We headed to Stoudsberg to a shooting range where Mike has a membership. Yes, This was a slice of heaven on earth to me. When we get down there we went to the sporting goods store where over 500 guns were stocked against the wall. Over 200 gunns were in the glass cases just ready for the pickng by an upstanding citizen; surely not me. After my penis was hard for over 40 mins; I had to leave. We stopped by this little diner THAT KICKED EVERY DINER'S ASS IN NYC!!! The breakfast alone was worth the 90 minute drive. We scarfed the food down in a record breaking 19 mins and we were off. Getting to the range was a bunch of twist and turns of the backroads of redneck country. I was looking for a naked white chic running from a maniac with a chainsaw; sure enough; that didn't happen. The range was kinda cool. We got there right on time to put up our own targets. The first gun that I tried to shoot was Tom's 45 cal. It had some serious recoil and it took me for a slight loop. I then regressed to Mike's 380. Shooting between the two was hot. These other kats showed up and they were shooting this 44magnum! That gun grew hair on your chest quick! That fuckin thing was the equivalent to a concentrated batch of viagra in your hands! We shot for about two hours and I haven't felt that good in years. I ddin't have to worry about cops running after me for shooting at somebody. I shot and shot and shot and had no worries. I had a great time with those two and they didn't get on my nerves.

doc00177,1,"Like i said in my previous blog, I arrived to work 5 minutes late riding on 4 hours of sleep. I definitely was not functioning right and the only pick me up I had was a visit next door to the coffee shop for soup and tea. John Faye and Cliff Hillis, of urlLink IKE , arrived around 12:30 and I was instantly rejuvenated. Their in-store performance lasted about an hour and it was fantastic. It sounded great and the store was absolutely packed. John asked me if it was too loud. I said no, I like my music loud and to feel free to break the windows. Newark Geroge made an appearance, and Cliff told him to have fun. It was interesting. They played Welcome Home for me, which of course is the anthem for the girlies. A very very good Saturday afternoon, but only a part of the wonderfulness that was the weekend. Fueled only on good vibes I was able tor un some errands and clean before picking up Tanya. We came back and were very antsy and played around on AIM and got ready. Dan brought the PBR and pizza and all was well. Shortly after Dan went to the venue to set up his bass stuff, Steve, Maryellen, and Morita came, followed by Michael and Chris and a girl whose name I forgot by now. Then John, Matt, and Brian. I think I got those names right. Mike or Matt. Argh. So we chatted and ate and drank. Michael came in with a green lighted leprechaun and I knew it was LoPresto's. Apparently every year his family gets together for St. Patrick's Day. Interesting. Though tonight I think our festivities include McGlynns and perhaps some car bombs. I wonder if the leprochaun will attend. Steve, Morita, and I went downstairs to check out some music, bother Charise, and grab some more booze. I was in a really giddy mood, so it was enjoyable. Charise and I sprawled ourselves on the floor talking while the boys perused the discs. Came back to hang out some more and I was greeted by Tanya with Chris on the phone. He was looking for an adapter that I randomly found in a bag in my closet. So he jogged up from the venue and we all left for the Balloon.

doc00183,4,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please. It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different? I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid. The debate today is whether or not ""under GOD"" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge. I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them. To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state. Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it. One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology. Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please. With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs. The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones. As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country. For those who are polytheistic, ""under god"" can be translated as recognizing a ""higher power"" than is visible in daily life. Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, ""under God"" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so. My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me! If ""Night"" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short! Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break? Because they all spark my interest. Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning. Love, Rob"

It was obvious, none. So we watched finding Nemo, but I have seen it so many times that I couldn't concentrate and just kept talking to him. He didn't seem to mind paying attention to me, and then began the tickling and the hand holding and... It began to get really late. We talked about him leaving again and again, but he just didn't get up. We cuddled, and it was fun and I could tell he was nervous and wanted to kiss me, but I just didn't want to be the one to make the move and be too forward. So, I was walking him to the door and he noticed the story I had read to him the night before: ""The Three Questions"" by Muth (based on Tolestoy). ""Do you remember the three questions?"" he asked. ""Of course."" ""Who is the most important person, what is the most important time, and I forget the third."" ""What is the right thing to do,"" I looked at him. ""What do you think the right thing to do is?"" I blushed, and kinda looked away. But, I turned back, and he still wouldn't kiss me, though he really wanted to. So we tried again, ""So you see, it's not a waste of time hanging out with me. I'm helping you study for your engineering test. It's Yellow Time."" (This will only be understood if I let you know we had a previous conversation about traffic lights.) ""That's right!"" ""So the question is do you speed up or slow down for the yellow light."" I said. ""What do you do?"" He asked. ""That depends on what it is we're talking about,"" and he really blushed. But he still just stood there. ""You're really nervous, aren't you?"" I said. ""Yes"" And before I new it I had my arms around him and was kissing him. He almost was okay, but then his lips went really tight as he was too nervous to kiss back. ""I really have no idea what to do"" he admitted. ""Just relax,"" I said. And he did right away. A real kiss, and then it was goodbye. He'd obviously never kissed before, but this was by far the most precious first kiss I've ever been a part of - even if he was so tight lipped and nervous. It makes a great story. After church I went to his place for dinner, and he was still adorably nervous. I finally got real compliments out of him, and there it was. Both of us have never moved this fast before. Both of us like eachother. I was even good and kept silent when his parents called while I was there. I'm sure he isn't ready to be teased by them yet. But I hooked him! That was easier than I thought. Now to just unhook the other guys that are calling me and hitting on me, etc. Derek would be to nervous to say anything to them I'm sure. :) I even told my parents about him. I'm scaring myself. I really need to call Idaho White tonight."

This is her night to be treated like a princess and I won't have you screwing it up. Get the message to Rob and Gossett, that applies to Amber and me too. Here's what you need to do: 1) Talk to Gossett and Rob about splitting a limo (remember this is April 17), and then book it. We won't need a stretch probably, just one big enough to hold 6 people. It needs to be at my house at 5:30. Make sure the guys know that everyone is coming to my house beforehand, around 4:30 for people's parents to take pictures, etc. Yall can just leave your cars here and then after prom the limo can bring us back and my mom will have a ""midnight breakfast"" thing fixed. The girls will spend the night and the guys will leave about 2:00 or whenever yalls parents want you home. 2) Make reservations at Carrabba's for six people at 6:00. That will give us about an hour and 45 minutes to eat, so we can leave about 7:45 and have about 20 minutes to get to the factory so we can make a fashionably late entrance (we don't want to be the first ones there). 3) Remember (and remind Rob and Gossett) to order (wrist corsages for everyone is best) corsages at least a week in advance. You will want to coordinate with your date's dress. Abby's dress is hot pink, so you'll want to tell the florist that. They're pretty good about helping you coordinate. I'll try to get her to give you a swatch of the fabric to give to the florist. 4) Get measured for and order a tux ASAP (like, say, this weekend, since I KNOW you have nothing going on since it was going to be a DI weekend) because otherwise they'll be all gone and you'll be stuck. Go with something pretty classic and you'll be safe. Please please PLEASE don't dress really outrageously. Now is not the time to be funny. That's a great way to make Abby and her mother mad. 5) Relate all this info to Rob and Gossett. And get ALL this done SOON. If you wait any longer, there will be nothing available and then you will be left with three incredibly angry girls on their prom night. It's not a pretty sight. So please get everything done in the next week. 6) If this stuff isn't done by the end of the month, I'm serious Josh, we are getting yall's parents on your case. And don't print this out because it'll make me look like a real witch."

doc00201,5,"I had a good laugh this week, it was a decent laugh that has lasted me from tuesday so far. I'm still chuckling at it. I was getting dressed on Tuesday morning and I had all my clean clothes in a heap on my top bunk (stupid bunk beds, I figured that I would have outgrown them by now, but I can't say I don't love them). My normal school clothes are as follows: blue jeans and a t-shirt My normal summer clothes are as follows: blue jeans rolled up to the knee and a t-shirt with the sleeves and neck cut out. I have soooo much variety. I love it. I find myself entirely and utterly amusing. If that makes me egotistical then so be it, I could use a little self esteem. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have myself to amuse me all of the time. Don't get your knickers in a twist now, for fear not, I am not off my rocker. It just gets lonely being an extrovert in a family of introverts. They all like their 'alone time' (as do I at times) but I need at least some human contact during the day. I had another good laugh at myself this morning. I dreamed that my mom was yelling ""Brielan (what a cumbersome name, tis my full name though, pronounced bree-linn) get your butt out of bed!!"" What made it so funny was that she had left for work a couple hours before and I was sleeping. It was at the exact moment that my mother at work said to herself ""brie's dad is going to be pounding on the door and she's going to be sound asleep, I hope she wakes up."" I certainly thought it was my mom yelling at me (that is how she wakes me up in the mornings for school, I don't believe in alarm clocks. Though the case is really that I have yet to find one that will wake me up.) I was up and out of bed in an instant. then I laughed because it was just a dream. I wonder if they have Jones Soda all over the world. It would be a shame if they didn't. Fufu berry is my favourite flavor. I have a soft spot for the creme soda though, tis wonderful. How could a person not love Jones Soda? In the mornings when my dad comes in with my newspaper I just sit and drink my soda and read my politics. Amazingly I have no political knowledge on the subject of politics even though I read dutifully about them everyday. Maybe I've picked something up without even realizing it. All I know is that Bush is the first president since 1911 to actually visit the UP. And he makes good jokes about Kerry and Edwards. But then I'm always reading in my democratic newspaper about how wonderful Kerry is, then I pick up my republican newspaper and read about Bush's wonderfullness. One of my favourite things in the world to do is to find the bias in the writing of others. When I write essays for school I always trash humans, I don't do it intentionally, its just that you can use the faults of the human race to your advantage in just about anyway imaginable. speaking of writing for school, I just finished my summer essay this afternoon. I love the last sentence even though it makes no sense really. ""A love forbidden is a love that shakes with its strength, tears with its pain, and escapes the world with lives in its grasp."" Isn't it lovely. It always stinks writing essays in the summer though, because I haven't met the teacher properly and can't write directly to the teacher. Thats a benefit of being in school. You get to know your english teacher and can write exactly what they want to hear. I never mastered that with my honors 2 teacher though. She just hated everything I wrote, even if it was good and she (albeit, grudgingly) had to give me an A. I think she disliked me because I didn't respond the way she wanted to a question when I first met her. She asked me: ""If you could be anywhere right now instead of being here, where would you be?"" my response was ""A deserted island."" She scowled at me and said ""Why?"" so I said ""Because I wouldn't have to deal with the ignorance of my classmates and teachers."" yeah I know it was rude, but I was a rude froshmen at the time. She had just rueamed me for having a name that wasn't spelled phonetically and I was a little peeved at her. So I was rather quiet, actally silent, when we were introduced to the Honors 3 teacher. I don't want him to hate me. I was in his book club for a couple of weeks in the begining of my soph year, but had to quit because it was too much. I still have one of his books. Okay, you know how when a car drives by the headlights make funny marks on the walls as they pass. Well theres one thats not moving on the porch. so my brain says: Theres a car in your driveway that has its lights on. They're gonna come and try to rape you!! So I'm gonna go hide upstairs in my room. I shouldn't be awake right now anyway. Rent a foreign film. Brie"

doc00203,2,"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. And how else can it be? The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven? And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives? When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. Some of you say, ""Joy is greater than sorrow,"" and others say, ""Nay, sorrow is the greater."" But I say unto you, they are inseparable. Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed. Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy. Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced. When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall."

doc00207,6,"Fee-cut will weaken IIMs: Narayana Murthy, Banga Murthy was speaking to the press along with Hindustan Lever Chairman M S 'Vindi' Banga. The two corporate stalwarts, along with marketing consultant Rama Bijapurkar, said that IIMs are not elitist. Banga said: ""Nearly 18 per cent of the IIM students are from the families whose annual income is below Rs 150,000. Another 60 per cent have a household income of below Rs 500,000. Only 22 per cent of the students come from families whose annual income is above Rs 500,000. So to say that IIM is catering to only the elite is wrong."" ""The government should not spend more on students who would be earning much more,"" Murthy said, adding that the average salary of an IIM-Ahmedabad graduate was about Rs 825,000 and the loan for fees could be repaid by the student easily in a couple of years. Describing the Union HRD ministry's decision as unilateral, Banga said there were a number of stakeholders who should be involved in the process. He noted that IIM-A was promoted by the central government, Gujarat government and corporates. ""There are 45 million children in India who don't go to school. There are 350 million illiterate people and in every rural school of our country there is just one teacher for two classes. So instead of reducing IIM fees, we should pay more attention to those things in our country. I mean we should not rob the poor and pay the rich,"" Murthy added. Read urlLink full-story ."

doc00212,3,"The past two days were my first doing all the teaching myself. So far I think it has gone fairly well. The first period was my test time, and I got done a lot earlier than I had planned. I think I kind of sped through the notes/lecture portion of the lesson. I had actually taught this lesson in the fall at my other internship, so it was kind of lucky that I had experienced it before. The lesson basically consisted of teaching the students the structure of DNA and the process of DNA replication. After a laser disc and my lecture, the students used a bead kit to construct a DNA molecule and then go through the steps of DNA replication. I have to say; those kits are made extremely cheaply. At the end of the day more than half of the white beads, which represented the deoxyribose, were broken. And they were not broken because students were mistreating them or anything---it was simply because the things are CHEAP! It is almost as if they want you to buy a new kit for each period of the day….no wonder it is hard for some school districts to have the supplies for students to do hands on activities. In other news I had my first parent-teacher conference today. A student’s parents came in to discuss how they could help their child better achieve over the next semester. He/she isn’t a poor student, in fact last semester they earned a B overall. We gave him a plan of action as to how to better use his time in going over the material, and I emphasized the fact that my lectures would emphasize the important points and that those are what he should focus on when studying. So, hopefully that will be helpful to him. This week has been spirit day at school. Monday was Pajama day, and a lot of the girls were wearing some inappropriate wear—oh vey. Today was tacky day and I didn’t take part. Tomorrow is hat day, and I think I am going to wear this swell vintage hat that has netting and all---maybe Ill get as many reactions as the tie-skirt got me. It is actually homecoming week; apparently we have two homecomings, one for football and one for basketball. A lot of the kids have been asking me if I will be going to the dance---since my teacher isn’t going, I probably won’t be either------though it is a masquerade ball—which sounds pretty cool."
doc00213,2,"Oh, if I only knew in high school what I know now. Nine years ago I graduated from a nice little school in Madison, Connecticut. It's a public high school for a fairly affluent community, where all the kids have money, cool clothes and nice cars. Except me. I had bad hair, bad clothes, bad acne, a bad car and bad grades (well, in math and science classes.) I was so dorky. I was the girl some guys made fun of because I was an easy target. Lets face it, when a cool guy writes ""hose beast"" on your locker, you're probably going to let it slide for fear of the ensuing wrath if you make a big deal about it. Never had a boyfriend, but I did manage to snag a date to the senior prom. It was a fun event where I got to feel like one of the cool kids, if even for just one night. Fast forward nine years, and now I'm a career girl with a college education and a lot of experience under my belt. I came to college and made up for lost time, and now I probably have as many ""party hours"" logged as those cool kids from years ago. Time has been good to me, too. I feel way more comfortable in my own skin. I've got my own money (well, a little bit of it, anyway) and I can use it to get highlights in my hair, if I so choose (which I do.) I am more interested in what I put into my body (i.e. food) and make conscious decisions to eat healthy stuff. It's true what they say, after all. A moment on the lips... a lifetime on the hips. I also have way more confidence than I used to. When you get down to the nitty gritty, and you take stock of your mettle, can you be proud of the person you are? I'm satisfied with my accomplishments, my mistakes and the things I've done to make myself a better person. My spirituality has grown immensely, and so has my sense of self. Only I know if I'm a ""hose beast."" (What the hell is that, anyway?) I can go to fun bars or cool restaurants if I want to. There's no secret handshake that keeps out all the high school dorks. Besides, when you get down to it, the high school dorks are the ones raking in the cash in the ""real world."" The high school dorks are today's engineers, attorneys and stock brokers. The cool kids from days past are now administrative assistants, bar bouncers and phys. ed. teachers. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I did pretty well for myself, too. All that journal writing that my parents bitched about has paid off. I work for a network affiliate as the producer of the 6 o'clock news. In a nutshell, I get to tell the anchors what to say and do, and even though there are a lot of stresses, it's still a pretty cool job. I went back home for my sister's wedding last month. Us young kids all went out to a bar after the rehearsal dinner, and I saw that guy who wrote ""hose beast"" on my locker 12 years ago. He did a triple take when I walked by.

I didn't even have the energy to get out of bed. YUCK! But now that I'm up and have cracked my back in multiple places, I'm feeling better. Making plans too see people this weekend while I'm up in Northern Virginia. It should be fun. Though I still have yet to get a hold of the mysterious Doc. *sigh* Oh well. I'll catch up with him soon enough. But now I need to get to work, cause I'm gonna work tonight for J. R. So I need to do laundry and get stuff like that done. This way I can get to work on time and have a little extra cash to pay some bills with. YEA!! :) But I'm gonna go do stuff. Talk to you later!"
doc00220,6,"Hmm... I haven't posted in a while. I'm still sick, and on Thursday I skipped school, partly because I wasn't feeling good, and partly because I was tired. ( I think they're interchangeable) Anyway, because of it, I'm slightly backed up in school work. Yesterday I went to two basketball games between my school and my best friend's and we lost to them (both the girl's game, and the guy's). It was kinda funny. I stayed over night at his house afterward, and we just sat around lazy, doing nothing. It was fun. :) Missed helping out at church (laying sod and stuff) cause we slept in, but whatever. I would have been really tired anyway, after it. Oh, Brady suddenly got his sight back on Wednesday night! I'm really happy for him."
doc00221,4,"so i've been a bit lazy lately and haven't motivated myself to add to this blog....&nbsp;&nbsp;i am going to make a very strong effort to turn that trend around NOW. a quick summary of things that have happened in my life since the last posting... 1.&nbsp; closed a three week run of a musical in the north suburbs, made some great friends and enjoyed the process thoroughly. 2.&nbsp; continued rehearsal and tech week for a dance show (this weekend) in Oak Park with the company that i perform with&nbsp;out there. 3.&nbsp; many, many meetings at work as i begin to get ready for my first real vacation in almost 2 years! 4.&nbsp; my ex-girlfriend and her sister came and stole the kitchen table that her family had loaned to me while we were still dating, since they are moving into their own place and need the furniture. tomorrow marks the 2 week countdown to my departure.&nbsp; i am excited."

doc00225,1,"I had a long shift today, but instead of actually eating a meal during my meal break, I just had a drink. Well, it was a Chai Creme Frappuccino that I accidentally made again for a customer. So my day's nourishment, until dinner time at 8 pm, was a tall Vanilla Creme (vanilla syrup and steamed milk), a grande Chai Creme Frappuccino, and a venti Mint Brownie & Creme Frappuccino (this is a special recipe that someone else showed me, which is pretty good, consisting of creme base, mint syrup, and brownie chips blended together). I haven't figured out the nutritional content of those drinks, but I'm pretty sure they were bad. But on the plus side, I'm getting plenty of calcium. And lactose-intolerance? Psssht! Well, actually, I overdid it a bit and ended up with a bit of delayed-reaction runs. (Oh don't you groan at me, missy!) On a more serious note, the work environment at Starbucks is... a conundrum. I mean, so far, of all my jobs since Cafe (at Berkeley), this place has had the best work environment. I think mainly because the people around are either near my age or younger (mostly younger), and there's a lot of personal interaction. When I was working at Kaplan, I was by myself mostly, and while I had great rapport with the students (at least in the second class), it was somewhat lonely being at the top. At the hak-won (the learning academy), it was even worse because they called me Miss Kang, instead of Jeanna. That and I had absolutely no support from the director. Anyway, I'm getting along okay with the other people of Starbucks. It's easier with the newer people, though. Mainly because the older people there are part of a cliche. And when I say older, I mean, those that have been there for awhile, even though the store's only a year old. Actually, the ages of these people are younger than mine. The second-in-command is only 20 years old. They go drinking together after work. Anyway I think they see me as either too old (i.e. tired), too square, or too shy. I don't want to appear shy, but I can be quiet. Anyway, it's not like I want to go drinking with them (I am too tired, and I can't afford the drinks, and I don't like beer) but it would be nice to have that same camaderie. Well.... Anyway, gotta sleep, I've got an early shift tomorrow followed by Korean BBQ outreach at church."
doc00226,2,"I just booked a hair appointment. A week on Saturday I shall no longer be a redhead, I'll be a brunette (with red tendencies). Here's to dismal failure. Interestingly enough, I just got hit on by the hairdresser (this *never* happens). Whilst waiting for my hair consultation, a male who had been staring at me approached me and said, ""Can I cut your hair? I want to give you a blunt fringe. Those eyes, I could lose myself in them. You need a blunt fringe to bring out your eyes"".

I know, I know - I'll never live that one down or do enough penance to clear that one up. But it was my first time voting & the Rs were pissing me off. As if I'd want to get an expensive education, just to be another Muffy Quayle. Gack. Yet, that's the message I got. Heck, I even thought I was a liberal! Those of you who know me are probably spewing your coffee all over your screen right now, eh? It was a confused time. Now I'm all better. But, on the Clinton subject - evidentally, he has a book out or something. For the record, I will not be buying or reading his ""biography."" He is veritable scum & I think he must be sociopathic.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. I feel completely worn out, yet my heart is constantly beating like crazy. My dad said it's because of the wellbutrin. He doesn't want me taking this shit because his co-worker's boyfriend died of a heartattack while on it. All I gotta say is that it sucks. My heart is racing 24/7, and it's beating so damn hard that it actually prevents me from falling asleep. I'm guessing this extreme fatigue is also due to the meds..my body's feeling so completely worn out that it's actually a bitch to just walk down the stairs. This isn't cool. Maybe if I drag my ass to the gym later I can get hyped up enough to actually workout. I swear the second I walk into that place I always get completely amped and energized, no matter how shitty or tired I was feeling before. We'll see. If I can just make it down the fucking stairs.. I ended up staying in last night because I was just too damn tired to go out by the time I got ahold of Eva. Sorry Eva..oh and I still think you're full of shit. Ok so she claims she was born and partially raised in the same Chicago suburb as me. No one I've talked to has ever heard of Glendale Heights, yet she expects me to believe we were both living in the same city at the same time? Yeaaaa ok. I think someone needs to put the pipe down and step away from the bong. heheh What the fuck am I doing today? Oh yea..Jon's coming back today so I think we're all having dinner later. Maybe watch a movie or something afterwards. Jon's a real cool guy, cheek-pinching fetish and all. I wonder what bitsy's up to..I swear she better not have shat on the carpet again. Bad kitty. She's so fucking spoiled it's no wonder she's constantly whining whenever she doesn't get all the attention. Seriously she won't shut up once she starts whining and meowing. I wish she had an on/off switch. That would be fucking badass. Oh yea, I had a dream that this guy I went to highschool with accused me of having a mullet. What a prick."

doc00230,4,"Today as the plane descended I was in awe of the clouds around me. I remember the first time I flew, about 9 years ago. The most beautiful sight, to me, was and is seeing the clouds from above. As the man made bird approached that land I thought to myself, ""One day I won't need this beast of steel. One day I'll raise to see these heights unencumbered by boarding passes, ticket lines, and attendants demanding that 'I return my seat and my tray-table to it's upright position'. One day I'll lay on these Godly cottonballs, and finally be able to rest."" I realised today how good creation is. When you look at the sky with it's brilliant blue, or the shimmering blades of grass that lay beneath your feet, see God. For God created it, he liked it, and said it was good. Soon you will be helpless but to fall to your knees, at the sheer wonder of it all. How small, insignificant, and helpless we are in the presence of God, the Father, Abba, Daddy."

doc00243,1,"urlLink On the dairy farm: A voyage into the milky way Herd produces 20,000 pounds a day BY KARA M. CONNERS Press & Sun-Bulletin NANTICOKE -- The faint smell of manure, drill-like hum of the milking machine and the occasional ""moo"" of more than 500 cows become fixtures of a day that starts at 5:30 a.m. and runs well into the night. On a recent afternoon, a black-and-white border collie-Labrador retriever mix named Diesel rolled in a sweet-smelling pile of sawdust, tugging on a leash held by 13-year-old Aubrey Whittaker. Aubrey is youngest of the three children who work on the Whittaker Dairy Farm, their parents' 800-acre operation off State Route 26. Some of the calves, each kept in an individual wooden hutch, crane their necks and lick Aubrey and her mother, Judi, with long purple-white tongues. The 40 members of the young herd chew and lick anyone or anything that walks by the hutches -- it's instinct. Yet the calves rarely complain, unless they need something. ""Just like a baby,"" Judi Whittaker said, ""the only time you hear from them is when they need something."" The coarse feel of the calves' sandpapery tongues and wet snouts are conditions to which Aubrey has adjusted since she began feeding the calves last fall. Thousands of flies buzz around the calves' plastic buckets of vanilla-scented milk and sweet-smelling grain. More flies stick to a bright green strip of fly paper draped over a row of hutches. Scott Whittaker's grandfather, Lewis Whittaker, founded the farm in 1915. Scott Whittaker's uncle Roscoe Whittaker inherited the farm. Scott and Judi bought the farm from Roscoe in 1981. In 1984, when the farm was milking about 100 cows, a fire destroyed two barns and killed 27 heifers. Since then, the family has built and expanded the farm into a $1-million-per-year agri-business that employs the five Whittakers and three other people. The operation includes a 1.6-million-gallon manure pit and a group of concrete-walled food bunkers. Each cow consumes 100 or so pounds of food and drinks 100 gallons of water daily. Across a worn path of gravel and dirt, a generator-like machine hums as a line of 20 cows slowly move into milking order. A cow must be at least 2 years old to produce milk; about 250 of the Whittakers' cows are old enough to be milked. The first of the three daily milkings begins at 5:30 a.m. and takes three to four hours. Inside a cool, metal A-frame building, Keith Yalch of Lisle wears a mud-stained T-shirt and work boots as he hoses the cows' udders with a sterilization solution to prepare them for milking. A milking machine latches onto the cow's udders like a vacuum cleaner and sucks the milk through a clear rubber tube into a 3,000-gallon steel drum, causing the cow's milk vein to swell like an enlarged intestine. The herd produces 20,000 pounds of raw, unpasteurized milk each day. After milking, Yalch dips each cow's udders in iodine to stimulate milk production. Piles of sand-like feed sit near the milking facility. The cows, which weigh about 1,400 pounds fully grown, eat ground corn, cotton seed and a protein mixture. The Whittakers will occasionally alter diets so the cows will produce milk that contains more protein or fat. A truck picks up the milk daily. Though it's tough to say exactly what dairy product the Whittakers' milk will become, it often goes to a processing plant in Waverly to be made into mozzarella cheese. The Whittakers have two of the six types of milking cows -- Jerseys and Holsteins. Jersey cows are brown or tan; Holsteins are black and white. A dry-eraser board lists the identification numbers of cows that are in heat, pregnant or sick. The pregnant cows are placed in a special barn as they wait to deliver. On July 4 a cow gave birth to triplets -- the first time on the farm in 30 years. The family normally doesn't keep the male calves; the bulls are typically sold for beef. ""When a male is born, their life is generally a lot shorter,"" Scott Whittaker said. Females live an average of eight to nine years. In each cow's right ear is a yellow or orange number tag containing the cow's birthday, and the Whittakers' herd information. In the cow's left ear is a metal identification tag that's part of the National Farm Animal Identification system, a database that helps farmers track animals' origins and geneaology. The federal government sets regional milk prices, which can significantly vary from month to month. Currently, milk is selling for $20 for 100 pounds; last year prices hovered around $11. Sometimes it can be an unsettling lifestyle. ""We really sweat it sometimes,"" Scott Whittaker said. ""Sometimes you are lucky to break even, and sometimes you are lucky to make a little money."""

I truly wanted this blog to be one of hope for us, guys. I wanted to give tips on picking the perfect gift, something that would make any woman's heart melt. And I wanted to teach a few little romantic gestures that never fail to take a woman back to that first moment when she looked at you and knew you were "" the one "". I wanted this to be the year that we prove we really can be everything the diamond commercials have taught them we are... But let's face it, who am I kidding? I'm just like the rest of you. When it comes to Valentine's Day, I might as well be a deer in the headlights (except, for the deer, the end is a lot quicker and less messy). I know my special lady has been waiting in breathless anticipation for the past month to see just how sweet, thoughtful, and romantic I'm going to be. What I don't necessarily know, is how to be all those things... I'm a guy , for crying out loud! My idea of thoughtful is showing her how to jiggle the handle on the toilet to stop it from running all night. And my experience with ""romance"" pretty much consists of those 5 minutes before love-making when I stroke her arm, cross one leg over hers and, with a raise of my eyebrows, say, ""So... uh... You wanna?"" I do not , however, think that giving her flowers is particularly thoughtful or romantic. How much thought does it take to walk into a florist, throw down 50 bucks, and ask for a dozen roses? None, that's how much. And you know why? Because if guys pondered the idea for even 2 seconds , they'd kick their own asses for dropping that much cash on something that is going to sit in a jar for 3 days before dying and, ultimately, being tossed stems-up into the garbage can. A bloody 2 dollar goldfish has better chances and more economic appeal than that! But, I digress... In the end, guys, we're going to do what we always do... We're going to put off doing anything about Valentine's Day until the actual day arrives. Then, we're going to scramble around to find something, anything , that might pass as a gift. And we're going to call every nice restaurant in town, only to find out that nothing is available thanks to all the pansy-ass, whipped guys who thought to make reservations in advance. Which will, inevitably, lead to us proclaiming that it is far more romantic to make supper for our women and serve it by candlelight. Unfortunately, considering our culinary skills, this will consist of spaghetti with sauce from a jar, Baby Duck wine, and one of those fat red candles with the fake holly berries left over from the Christmas decorations. Some things will never change... But wait! I wanted to leave you all with a little bit of hope... A friend of mine by the name of Clint Vander Klok (perhaps you've heard of him...?) has stumbled across a way for our women to repay us for the trials and tribulations we endure at this time of year and bring a long-awaited balance to the universe. If you'd like to find out what this brilliant answer to all men's prayers is, just surf on over to urlLink http://www.clint.ca/oldnews/steak.htm ... I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

doc00250,5,"urlLink Bush's ""Good News"" Conference, by Sheila Samples - Democratic Underground : This is here just for the entertainment value. No need to refute. Interesting that the Left take the following position on Israel. ""When asked about his biased policies toward Israel, Bush launched into his scripted, inane, and totally incomprehensible spiel about how Palestine must first stop the terrorism so they can 'live side by side with Israel.' "" And this - Move on. Nothing to discuss here. Given Bush's doctrine on WMD and on what constitutes a terrorist regime, why would he discuss the only nuclear power in the Middle East... the only country in the region that refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty... the only country that defiantly refuses to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities... the only country that gives the finger to United Nations resolutions... the only country that occupies land belonging to its neighbors, and the only country that continues to attack and destroy its neighbors without fear of retribution every single day? Me: THe only country that gives the finger to the UN? What about Iraq, or even Iran for that matter? Attack and destroy neighbors without fear of retribution? Would this guy like to eat at an Israeli Cafe?? Remarkable how such virulent hatred is reserved for Bush, Israel and conservatives, while the murderers get a free pass."
doc00251,5,"Oh man, i just got back from making a movie with Kendra, Kristen, and Nadia called ""The Nationality Rangers"". It was sooooo funny. Basically we're people from different cultural backgrounds who joined together to defeat the Evil Chairman and his Evil Teapot. I was the Finnish girl Wayne Gretzky, Kendra was the German Keg Drinker, Nadia was the ghetto Bronx girl and Kristen was the Ultra Smiley Spanish person. I was also the voice of the evil chairman. If i tried to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand, so i'm not going to waste my time. you just have to watch it. We also watched this video of our whole group going to prom and it was acted out in the form of barbies. I went to prom with a guy that lost his leg in a freak hockey accident, LOL DALLAS WINS OVER COLORADO 5-1!!!!!!!! WHAT WERE THE ODDS OF THAT!?!?!?! My mom told me that my Niko did so good tonight (i didn't watch it because i was making a movie) and i'm so proud of him!!! WHATS THAT CHEER WE LIKE TO HEAR? GO DALLAS GO DALLAS GO!!!!!

But everyone counted on me as a ride, when I told them not too because things were up in the air, so alas, we have no ride. Dad's working up on the roof, and Mom has to be to work tomarrow at like 5 in the morning. Damn I wish I could drive. I haven't even gotten out on the road yet, when I've had my permit for about two months now. Things are startng to make me aggrivated. Maybe I need a break from people. I think that's what it is. People depend on me too much. Don't ask why. I don't know why they would be like that with me. I'm going to go find something to do. Maybe I'll play some stuff on my guitar. Yeah, that sounds good.

doc00254,4,"Linds, you brought up a good point that I had completely forgotten about. You guys have been there for me with this whole divorce shit, but Becca MADE ME CRY. Let me say that again. Cry. Me. Z. The implacable. Or something. ;) And then again, she didn't really do it, but I was in such a bad mood to begin with that arguing with her and trying to prove how much pain I was in made me cave. But I'm doing better now. Honest. Well, I think. I also was upset for Becca at the time. Obviously I know what it's like to lose people, whether they're leaving or dying, but I had no idea that this was some DISTANT relation. For all I know, she really did care, except for Linds's testimony, but I can't believe that she would dare to think that an uncle, distant or not, is more important than someone's HOME LIFE FALLING DOWN AROUND HER. I'm sorry if that was extraordinarily bitchy or mean or selfish, but now I'm really pissed off. More so than I was before. Linds was also right in the original sides thing. Rosie, you really didn't turn me to your side. I found out information, some from you and some from Linds or Will or whoever else, and that was what made me change my mind. So don't feel guilty about it, Little China. *grin* Anyway, just had to say that. Um, two things. 1) What did you mean when you said that Phillip's like me? Just curious. And 2) Those seniors have no idea what they're talking about, except for the biased story they've heard from Becca. I mean, are they your friends, aside from Gunter? If so, I don't know what you should do, but if not, then tell them to fuck off. I'm serious. They have no business getting involved. Period. Abby, I thought you knew me. Kind of. I'm not sure of that, but I thought you did. ;) hehehe Also...if you don't want to hear anymore about the divorce, let me know, but I'm kind of using this Blog to get it off my chest. I don't really have another place. Anyway, this weekend my dad and I had bonding time. ALL SATURDAY. It was all right, but not really awesome except that I did get to see X2 which was REALLY GOOD. Anyway, on Saturday I went to his new house. Not to stay but just to look around. It's in Mooreland, that place on Moores Lane on the way to the mall. It's really little and WHITE. It feels like a sterile environment. I'm making him have my room painted. Anyway, that's about it, but it was pretty hard to do it. Don't think he picked up on that, so I guess that I'm making it through all right. So, back to Operation Becca, just one question. What the hell are we actually going to do about it? Please let me know just so I have an inkling. I feel like I should be really guilty about something or other right now. Nah. ;) ~Z"

But it was all part of the fun on Sunday as prison officials held an elephant match to discourage inmates from gambling on the Euro Cup in Portugal. 'We expect that people will support the idea that we can get fun from playing football, not gambling on football,' said director-general Nathee Chitsawang of the Thai Corrections Department in Ayuthaya, north of Bangkok. The prisoners took on the animals, ridden by elephant drivers, from the Ayuthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal. But the result was unclear: either a 5-5 draw or a creditable 7-6 win for the elephants, the BBC reported. After the game, one of the most prolific elephant scorers, Kocharaa, celebrated by kicking its front legs in the air. 'We train the elephants every day to play soccer, kick the ball, and to keep from stepping on the other people,' said Mr Pattarapon Meepan of the Elephant Palace. 'They try their best. These elephants can do everything.'"

I tried to remember everyone's name in the office, but was unsuccessful. I think that I will remember Peggy, the office manager, next time, though. Just in case anyone was wondering, when I got home yesterday at 2:45, I slept straight through until 6:00 p.m. I was exhausted. One thing that really struck me about the meetings and interactions yesterday was the extent to which student privacy is an issue. Teachers are not allowed to post or announce any test scores, students cannot grade each others papers (without alot of hoop jumping,) one teacher is not allowed to know the grades of their students in another class. In Guy's class, the websites that students create for projects cannot be posted onto the Internet, only on the CLP web. I have even heard that a teacher is not allowed to have any pictures taken with their students that show the identity of the students. This is an unfortunate consequence of the way the world is nowadays, I suppose. More later."
doc00284,5,"+Urban Definition of the Day: Shasty. Pronounced: Shas-tee. Adjective describing things that are messed up or wrong. For example, ""Sometimes, life is shasty,"" or, ""That girls face is shasty!"" I never quite start my blog out right. It always ends up boring, so today I decided to put a crazy definition to spice things up a bit. Anyways, if I was a different person reading my blog, the first thing today I would want ao know would be there whereabouts of the small child also known as Fizzgig. So this is what happened with him since I last posted: at about 4 a.m. I finally got him to go to bed, so I went to bed too, alone...:(...sleeping so lightly because I was afraid he would come in my room and do something. Then apparently he woke up at around 6 a. m...yea, running on 2 hours of sleep, not something I would do but if he wants to, sure...why not? So he got up and watched TV for a while and sometime his grandpa brought out some medicine for him and notified the parentals that he was going out of town for the day, leaving him with us, so Mom and Jim took him shopping in Champaigne and then out to dinner at Red Lobster. He left with about 10 pair of shorts, 5 shirts, 2 pair of shoes, a hat, and some boxers. I'm beginning to think this retrieving tennis balls thing is a good idea...worked perfectly for him anyways. They returned home around 7 and he just did random things such as riding his bike and the scooter and swimming and finally he went home at about 8. Other than this, I can faitfully describe my day in one word: uneventful. I was left home alone, which doesn't bother me at all. It gave me some time to think about things, everything...but where'd it leave me? Nowhere really. Screw brains, they don't help anything. I actually spent time thinking of phrases I would learn if I went to a country that speaks a language other than English, but most of them are mean, so for the sake of my life in case a foreigner would just happen to come apon my site, I'll only post one of them. It came about when I was thinking of the trip to Mexico we took back in May or around then...one thing that sticks out in my mind is all of the male Mexicans hitting on me, no matter what age. So I thought of something I could reply to that, in any country with horny men lol. ""Jo kashish hai, woh tho sirf andar ki dard chhupa raha hai,"" which translates to: ""The magnetism you talk about is only hiding the pain inside."" Sure it would turn a couple of heads and possibly confuse them, but it would stop them from throwing comments and proposals for a few minutes right? I surfed around on the net for a good many hours today just looking for something to occupy my time, and came across a site that told me what my name would be if I were a squirrel. ""Arch Bishop McNutt""...lol, so for a small furry animal, I think being the leader of a province or something of equal power doesn't sound half bad! That's about all I found that sparked my interest on the net. I got offline at about 6 and spent a couple of hours playing Pacman, still unable to beat the level me and Tyler got stuck at that one morning...speaking of Tyler, I talked to him once today only for about 10 minutes, and the conversation consisted of a bet...which I lost...and a few nice thoughts. Well, that's all that's coming to mind tonight so I'm going to leave you with some lyrics and talk the night away on MSN...such a wonderful life...yea right... Underoath-A Boy Brushed Red...Living in Black and White Can you feel your heart beat racing? Can you taste the fear in her sweat?

doc00285,4,"For this week's Theology Thursday topic, let me just go ahead and start out with my ""shock statement:"" Christians should do away with tithing. Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's go to the Bible. God instituted tithing back in the day of Moses. Actually, there were at least two separate tithes (perhaps 3, if you consider the sacred feast in Deut 12:17-18): 1. A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the Lord (Lev 27:30). This was paid to the Levites, who gave a tenth of that to the priests (Nu 18:26). 2. At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store it in your towns... (Deut 14:28). This tithe was again for the non-salaried Levites but also for the widows, orphans and the destitute. Nowhere in the New Testament is there any command to tithe.&nbsp;In fact, the word ""tithe"" is only mentioned like 3 times in the whole New Testament.&nbsp;Why is this? Well, look at the recipients of the tithe: primarily the Levites and the priests. Christ's death did away with our need for the temple (and its workers) and for the priests as intercessors; we can all now access God directly. There is no Jew nor Greek - we are all priests now, and the ""chosen people"" are now lumped in with the rest of the races on planet Earth (or rather, WE were lumped/grafted in with THEM). The tithe is the law; we are no longer under law but under grace (Rom 6:15). Now keep reading, before you start thinking you're getting off easy. Jesus came to tell us that it's all about where your heart is, not just your actions. Don't murder? Piece of cake. Don't be angry with your brother and insult him (Matt 5:21-22)? Much harder. Don't commit adultery? I can do that. Don't look at a woman lustfully (Matt 5:27-28)? Ouch. So when I tell you that the New Testament doesn't support tithing (which literally means ""tenthing""), guess what? I think the Bible implies we should be giving much more than that. My intro statement was that Christians should do away with tithing...I never said we should do away with giving. Consider the following quote from 2nd century Church father Irenaeus (the disciple of Polycarp, who was John's disciple - so I guess that makes him Jesus' great granddisciple): "" The Jews were constrained to a regular payment of tithes; Christians, who have liberty, assign all their possessions to the Lord, bestowing freely not the lesser portions of their property, since they have the hope of greater things. "" Here's what Christian Generation 1.0 showed us about how to give. They sold their stuff and gave money to any (believers) in need (Acts 2:45). They sold property and gave the entire amount to the work of the apostles (Acts 4:36-5:2). They generously and enthusiastically gave towards Paul's work, giving ""as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability"" (2 Cor 8:1-5). They supported Paul over and above his need (Phil 4:18) ""again and again"" (Phil 4:16). These people were living out Jesus' words, ""Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also"" (Matt 6:21). You know, Paul DOES tell us that we should set aside a portion of our income each week. He doesn't say how much, but does imply that if you make very little, you give very little; if you make a lot, you give a lot. He tells the Corinthians, Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver (2 Cor 9:7). How many times do pastors put us ""under compulsion"" by implying we're sinning if we don't obey ""God's command to tithe?"" How many times are we guilt-tripped into tithing because we're robbing God if we don't (Mal 3:8-9)? I'm sorry, but I think that keeping a ministry going (and funded) sometimes motivates pastors into misapplying what God says about tithing. Or maybe these pastors are just frustrated because the average American Christian puts 2.5% of his/her income into the offering plate. It's amazing that the Jews under the Law gave 23% a year, while we under grace give a tenth of that. Bottom line: We, as believers, should be giving generously and even sacrificially towards God's work. How many of us do that? I have to admit that Jane and I still feel that we're not there. We still take too much and give too little. So I'm not just preaching here; I'm praying. Next week's topic: Crowns Are More Than Heavenly Frisbees"

doc00287,5,"Yea verily, I shall make a list, and the list shall be discussed in order and the list shall compose of five parts. No more, no less. Five shall be the number thou shall read, and the number of reading shall be five. Six thou shall not read, nor shalt thou read four, excepting that thou then proceed to five. Six is right out. Once the number five, being the fifth number, be reached, thou shalt clickest thy Holy Button of Commenting with thy mouse, and typist thou a comment. That was lame. The List: 1) Ashley stayed over last night. I haven't had anybody over at my house since Phoebe in eighth grade. I just don't do it. We had fun, but I kept excluding her to check my email...nobody came to get us today, so we called Treola and her mom came for us. We squished in the truck, it wasn't terrible. But since four people needed a shower this morning, I only had time for a quick rinse. And I went with her to church last night. I've decided that a lot of Christianity is Pagan. Or the other way around, but we stand in circles to pray and we sing and stuff. Same with band, but I'll discuss that later. Anyway, when we were supposed to be silently praying with our pray partners, I pretended I was a tree and had roots and the prayers we were sending were the leaves, growing with good energy then falling and flying into the wind to the person who needed them. I'm a little heathenchild. But a bunch of people from band go. Anyway...there's another part to this story that I shall discuss later. 2) Guard camp is le suck. I only had to march for two and a half hours because of orientation, but I'm still tired. It's getting fun, though. My tan lines are evening out because of the car wash, but now I have bikini lines AND a neckline. Which means I have to find somewhere for topless sunbathing within the next week. I know tanning is bad, but if I'm going to be involuntarily dark, it's going to look right. I refuse to throw out EVERY SINGLE shirt I wear because of tanlines. Anyway, band is very Paganish (I know I'm throwing the word around incorrectly. Shut up). I mean, think about it. We stand in circles and play music and march, which is basically dancing, and we chant. We're raising energy. We have a circle ritual that we do EVERY TIME we do a circle drill. Band is also like a cult...you don't let anybody leave without a grudge, and people are always recruiting, and yeah. 3) The Guard had a car wash today. In front of the West Fork branch of the Bank of Fayetteville. We didn't think we'd get any customers because we were having it IN West Fork, but we made WAY over 200 dollars. We can buy tops for everyone, and get half a pole apiece, and the school pays for the rest. All WE have to pay for is our pants and rifles. And we're having another car wash after school starts, we're putting signs up around the school. That's how I got my bikini line, I wore a bikini top and short shorts. Which brings me to a tangent. Joseph Keck was my cynic buddy in English. He was the first person to accept me here and we would sit around and make fun of everybody for being stupid. When we read Julius Caesar in class, we always got the main roles and made fun of everyone for reading monotonously...Joseph got accepted into the Maths and Sciences School in Siloam, so we never get to talk. I HAVE his email, but I forgot it. Some old game with a V that's a double entendre...I'll have to google it, I guess. Anyway, I MISS Joseph. I'm pretty sure he thought I was stupid and spastic towards the end of the year, when I went psycho for a couple weeks, but I still want to talk to him. Anyway. I was standing in the parking lot of the bank dripping wet in my bikini, spinning my flag. And he drives up. To get his car washed. I didn't say anything to him, I didn't get contact information, I feel SO STUPID. I'm honestly a huge idiot. His dad is running for state rep, so Joseph gave us little propaganda cards to hand out to customers. The only thing I said to him was ""Nice propaganda, Joseph."" :-( I'm still kinda upset. My sunburn hurts like a bitch. Missy, Peggy, and Amanda Grace went for lunch at the mall. They come back two hours later. TWO HOURS. There were only four people washing cars for about an hour. And at LEAST one person had to hold the sign the whole time. Oh, and when we were leaving, Peggy and Missy volunteered to stay behind and clean up the parking lot themselves. They should have gotten there MAYBE fifteen minutes late, and even that is giving them the benefit of the doubt. Instead, they skip practice. Maybe Joseph will come to a football game. 4) There's a mission trip Saturday with Ashley's church to help a children's shelter, dishes, yardwork, painting, stuff like that. I wouldn't go if they were spreading godly propaganda, but I'm fine going because this is great charity work. A bunch of girls from band go to church as well, some people I really enjoy. I'm not going to be a churchie, I'm a heathen and as such, I need time to worship my computer. If I started church, I'd be forced to work Saturdays and Thursdays, and I already don't have enough time off. Anyway, here's my schedule for the next few days: Tomorrow: Laundry Nail polish Pack Practice Guard at threeish? Home with Ashley Mission sleepover Saturday: Up around 4 Leave at 5:30 Little Rock to help Home around nine thirty Sunday: Work! (I have no choice, I NEED the money.) 5) I got out of an hour and a half of marching practice and sectionals because there was junior orientation. You couldn't get your schedule or anything without your parents there. I didn't know that. They never said anything. I call my mom, she refuses to come until she's eaten dinner. She shows up, barely late, I get my schedule which is exactly the same as it was when I planned it in May. I see Joe Doke, Monica's brother. They're in the same grade...I have a serious agenda relating to the secret I may or may not have mentioned. The secret I want to keep for a bit. Hm. Anyway, I saw a bunch of people I don't really like, Treola and I are the juniors in Guard, and we were sitting one table apart, and we kept looking at each other when he mentioned the dress code because Treola ALMOST showed up in a halter top. It was all she had, but Stephanie loaned her a t-shirt. I love being in Guard, because now it doesn't matter what happens, who doesn't like me, I have people who are forced to be around me, and that makes me feel welcomed, superficially at least. But after this week, I think the Guard is actually FRIENDS. I like these people, and I'll hopefully get to know them better. I want to. It's going to be great catty fun. Apparently Stephanie told Treola that Amanda's fat...Amanda is NOT fat, Amanda's GORGEOUS. And really, really sweet. Yeah, the principal is delusional. He's proud because 44 percent of the juniors last year are proficient at reading. He's like, deliriously proud. And that's weird. Why? Because the numbers in TEXAS were like 83 percent last year, and I was in a fairly low school... I'll pick this up tomorrow, because I promised five and yea verily I have finished."

doc00293,3,"Last night I was on the Something Like Silas website and I saw that in San Diego they were playing at something called ""Flood"" a lot, so I googled ""Flood San Diego"" and I found out that its a cuhrch thing. It looks really really really awesome. I was on their website a long time last night. I definately want to go out there. &nbsp; The only really bad part about it is that its clear out at College Avenue Baptist (like 30 minutes away) and it would be on a Sunday night that we went. Their only services are at 5, 7 and 9 pm. Whats really good though is that I can get a new start there. At Cornerstone I'm the evil sinner person, here they can see me for what I really am. Also its like a huge youth church. Most people there are between 18 and 28 according to the website. And their High School ministry looks small, so maybe I can easily become a leader again or something? I doubt any church will let you just jump up in there like Cornerstone does though. Thats unheard of. To be in leadership after like...3 weeks. Maybe it was my charm? (joke) &nbsp; Whats even better I think Something Like Silas leads the Worship at Flood.

doc00295,1,"NEVER TO RETURN: Minchin's no-dump guarantee By PAUL STARICK and LEANNE CRAIG 15jul04 SOUTH Australians have been issued ""an absolute, unqualified, rolled-gold guarantee"" that interstate nuclear waste never will be dumped in the state. Finance Minister Nick Minchin, who spearheaded the Federal Government's plans for a national dump near Woomera, yesterday guaranteed those plans were abandoned – for all time. Senator Minchin told The Advertiser he absolutely rejected Labor accusations that the Government would change its mind after this year's election. Asked if he could give a guarantee this would not happen, Senator Minchin said: ""An absolute, unqualified, rolled-gold guarantee."" He said the Government would pursue the states to ensure they created dumps for their own waste. The move marks a dramatic shift from statements Senator Minchin made as science minister in October 2000 that having nine separate repositories ""defies logic"". ""The idea we should now build not one, but nine low-level waste repositories is absurd,"" he said in the October 2000 press release. Yesterday, he repeated Prime Minister John Howard's promise that a co-located dump for federal low and intermediate-level waste would not be built in SA. ""There are no circumstances under which we will be putting this in SA,"" he said. Senator Minchin said even if other states eventually demanded a national repository in SA, against the wishes of Premier Mike Rann, the Government now would not agree. ""If the other state premiers have a problem, they should speak to Mr Rann,"" he said. ""We tried and failed to acquire land in SA (for a national repository). We now expect Mr Rann to be building a state repository and we will be riding it hard."" Mr Rann said ""in this mighty David and Goliath battle – David has won"". ""But, you don't win if you don't try and persistence and commitment always pay off, particularly if you are united behind a cause that is a good cause,"" he said."" ""I did not want to see South Australia with the tag `the nuclear waste dump state'."" Both major parties guaranteed they would remove 10,000 drums of radioactive waste stored at Woomera for almost a decade. Opposition Leader Mark Latham overruled his environment spokesman, Kelvin Thomson, who said the low-level waste would stay at Woomera. A spokesman for Mr Latham and Labor industry and science spokesman Kim Carr said Labor would establish a national repository outside SA, then take the Woomera waste there. Speaking before Senator Minchin, Mr Latham said the Government was ""likely to reverse their decision once the election is out of the way"". ""For eight years they have been trying to get the dump into SA and the only reason they are saying this today is because there is an election coming up,"" he said. ""People in SA would know that they will be back to their old form as quick as a flash."" Mr Howard said the Government's decision to abandon the dump plans had been forced by ""the worst aspects of unco-operative federalism"". ""This has come about because of the `not in my back yard (syndrome)',"" Mr Howard said. He said the prospects were ""at best, 50-50"" of a successful High Court appeal to a Federal Court ruling that the Government's land acquisition process for the dump had been flawed. ""Given the court decision, there was nothing to be achieved by going on,"" he said. ""If the states are refusing in practice to cooperate, if they're adopting this destructive attitude, then I will flush back on them the responsibility of looking after their own waste. ""If they want to play sovereign state politics, not-in-my-state politics, okay, they can do that. ""But they will have to look after their own waste."" Australian Conservation Foundation executive director Don Henry said the scrapping of dump plans was ""a welcome victory for the SA community"". He said South Australians had realised the potency of ""people power"" and urged them to apply this with renewed energy to saving the River Murray. No, let's not dump nuclear waste in Woomera. (My birthplace by the way). But let's continue to incarcerate regugees there in concentration camps. Refugee women and children...because we're just so convinced that these people are all terrorists..pfffftttt....This sure is not the lucky or the free country for some."

doc00310,6,"Apple Computer Inc. on Wednesday said its iPod mini digital music player would be available internationally, beginning July 24, at a price of $249. In March, the company said it would delay the international launch of the player due to stronger-than-expected U.S. demand and tight supplies of the hard drive, which is at the core of the player. Apple had originally planned to start worldwide shipping in April. Earlier this year, the company said it had 100,000 preorders for the iPod mini, a smaller version of the popular iPod player that is about the length and width of a business card and holds about 1,000 songs. The company, best known for its Macintosh computers, has found huge success in digital music. Apple has sold more than 3 million iPods and has a 50-percent market share of digital music players. Its iTunes online music service is the most popular legal music download sites, claiming 70 percent of all songs bought online."

doc00332,4,"Before I forget again, I wanted to post something on God-given talents. I have an acquaintance who raps. He also happens to be a Christian fundamentalist and, oddly enough, he raps about God. This is fine -- whatever makes his bed rock and all that -- but I have to wonder what's going through his head while he raps. Does he feel God's spirit moving through him? Does feel that he's going to convert someone to Christianity through his rap? I joked with a friend one day, ""You know, I've been an athiest all my life, but your rap really changed my mind."" I seriously think he's waiting for this scenario to play out. I expect him to say that his rapping talent is God-given. So this got me thinking about what exactly is a God-given talent. Does rapping even qualify? If so, what about a talent like walking and chewing gum? What if I was the best there ever was at walking and chewing gum? I've logged thousands of miles walking and chewing gum, and I've never slipped, fallen, gotten out of step, spit out or swallowed my gum, or forgotten to chew. I'm just hoping that my God-given walking and gum-chewing talent will show people the light. What if I could point out physical or mental flaws with people? Is that a God-given talent? What about the ability to steal anything and not get caught? What about if I was able to kill people better than anyone who's ever lived? Would God grant someone such a dark blessing? What exactly qualifies? The answer came to me as I was stuffing envelopes, of all things. It all ends up being a matter of perspective. Walking and chewing gum may not be a God-given talent, but perhaps dexterity is. Rapping may not qualify, but maybe eloquence does. As for the darker gifts I alluded to, there may be aspects like insight, foresight, or intelligence inherent in any of those ""skills"" -- these are the qualities may be God-given, but it's how you use your talents that's important. And anyway, it all remains a matter of perspective: you see what you want to see. ""Wow! His rap is amazing! Only God could create such an awesome ability!"" or ""Oh crap, here comes that rap guy again. I'm sure the devil put him here to annoy me."""

doc00334,2,"A Picture of the Kingdom Another image from the history of the Church: From Cyprian (who said ""The example of living is given to us in Christ."") taken from his treatise ""On the Advantage of Patience"": But what and how great is the patience in God, that, most patiently enduring the profane temples and the images of earth, and the sacrilegious rites instituted by men, in contempt of His majesty and honour, He makes the day to begin and the light of the sun to arise alike upon the good and the evil; and while He waters the earth with showers, no one is excluded from His benefits, but upon the righteous equally with the unrighteous He bestows His undiscriminating rains. We see that with undistinguishing equality of patience, at God's behest, the seasons minister to the guilty and the guiltless, the religious and the impious-those who give thanks and the unthankful; that the elements wait on them... And that we may more fully understand, beloved brethren, that patience is a thing of God, and that whoever is gentle, and patient, and meek, is an imitator of God the Father; when the Lord in His Gospel was giving precepts for salvation, and, bringing forth divine warnings, was instructing His disciples to perfection, He laid it down, and said, ""Ye have heard that it is said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and have thine enemy in hatred. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them which persecute you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, who maketh His sun to rise on the good and on the evil, and raineth upon the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward shall ye have? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye shall salute your brethren only, what do ye more (than others)? do not even the heathens the same thing? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect."" Maybe patience is one way that we point to a ""story that is bigger than our own""???"

You see, I have never wore a tank top before, but in the safety of my house. Never ever in public. Never ever without a jacket. Never ever without being thin. See, my arms are a big issue for me. I have always hated them. They are not nice and toned. They have stretch marks. They are big. But the last days I spend some time with them. I think of them. I talk to them. I spend more time moisturising them. To give you an idea of how far I have gone, I admired their tan this morning. And it was then that I thought of something: The parts of my body that need the most work, are the parts of my body I used to hate. Arms fall under this category. But hating them, neglecting them, denying them even will never solve their problem. As a matter of fact I was thinking that the more I deny them the more of a problem they become. So I decided to acknowledge their existence and show them to the world. So spending my day on a tank top so far has taught me this: I am the worst, more strict judge for myself. Perhaps I should loosen up a little and treat myself like I treat other people. And oh! Oh please, do not worry. I will not wear a mini skirt next!"

doc00348,4,"It occurred to me tonight as I dressed P for bed with her sassy mouth that here was this PERSON standing in front of me, four years old, with a mouth that was sassing me. And I could barely believe it. My father kept a picture of me on his desk at work until he retired from the police department when I was 16. (He still works, just not for the police department.) In the picture, I was five years old. I remember saying to him, ""Dad, why don't you get a new picture? I don't look like that now!"" He said, ""There will be an age you will fall in love with and every time you see your child -- no matter how old they are -- they will be that age. They are always that age in your mind."" I liked his idea a lot, but I think it is even more dimensional than one age and one picture. I realized tonight that whatever P says and does, she is a hundred different P's to me. Newborn P, the first time I held her. Baby P, sitting in her bouncy chair. Toddler P, pronouncing cheese ""sheesh."" Three-year-old P, munching potato chips. Four year old P, talking to me through a puppet. All that history, all at once, which feeds into our joys, our fears, our expectations and our reservations. I think the reason why we bring such intensity to our parenting roles is because the child literally goes from nothing to everything right before your eyes. From a seed to a stalk to a sapling to a tree. And everything you say or do has the power to influence that transformation. It's a tall order. And you never stop missing the budding and blooming of the previous seasons. You can't hold an afternoon and its sunshine, it just slips from you, and you have to look as hard as you can at it to even approximate one shadow. The seasons pass and there is regret. Even as you look forward to the ones to come."

Selling 214,000 copies, ""Confessions"" now parks three tracks in the top ten: ""Burn"" at number one, ""Yeah!"" at number four and ""Confessions, Part II"" at number nine. GORE ON BUSH: THE STORY REMAINS THE SAME "" Here is the pattern that I see: the President's mishandling of and selective use of the best evidence available on the threat posed by Iraq is pretty much the same as the way he intentionally distorted the best available evidence on climate change, and rejected the best available evidence on the threat posed to America's economy by his tax and budget proposals. In each case, the President seems to have been pursuing policies chosen in advance of the facts -- policies designed to benefit friends and supporters -- and has used tactics that deprived the American people of any opportunity to effectively subject his arguments to the kind of informed scrutiny that is essential in our system of checks and balances. The administration has developed a highly effective propaganda machine to imbed in the public mind mythologies that grow out of the one central doctrine that all of the special interests agree on, which -- in its purest form -- is that government is very bad and should be done away with as much as possible -- except the parts of it that redirect money through big contracts to industries that have won their way into the inner circle. For the same reasons they push the impression that government is bad, they also promote the myth that there really is no such thing as the public interest. What's important to them is private interests. And what they really mean is that those who have a lot of wealth should be left alone, rather than be called upon to reinvest in society through taxes. Perhaps the biggest false impression of all lies in the hidden social objectives of this Administration that are advertised with the phrase ""compassionate conservatism"" -- which they claim is a new departure with substantive meaning. But in reality, to be compassionate is meaningless, if compassion is limited to the mere awareness of the suffering of others. The test of compassion is action. What the administration offers with one hand is the rhetoric of compassion; what it takes away with the other hand are the financial resources necessary to make compassion something more than an empty and fading impression.

doc00350,5,"Every morning between 6 and 8 I get awoken by my sisters dog, Diesel. She is so annoying. Jeff leaves for work around 6 and around that time my sister lets her dog out of her room. Well as soon as Jeff leaves, Diesel sits right in front of my bedroom door and whines. Not only does she whine but she seriously, like, tries to beat my door down. I kid you not! She bangs into the door and then she takes her paws and drags them down the door leaving scratch marks all over it. Yeah. This is how every morning goes. I try and ignore it until I can't take it anymore. And don't think I don't yell at her and tell her to stop. She'll just look at me wagging her tail and as soon as I shut the door she's at it again. Every morning. Anyways. Did anyone catch the season finale of Smallville last night?(That Tom is such a hottie!) If Chloe is dead I'm going to be VERY upset. I hate season finales. They're so nerve-wracking. Now I have to wait, what, 3 months until I get to know what happened? Torture."
doc00351,1,"I just got back from my Law & Order callback. These are my interpretations of the thought processes surrounding an audition where I felt like I gave a good reading. Before the initial audition: Wow. Look at this script. I'm surprised that I got submitted for this. I guess I could be this guy. Maybe. They may have to stretch their imaginations a bit, but I could do it. This is tough material. How the hell am I supposed to say that line? This is hard. Oh, well. Here goes nothin'. After the inital audition: Huh. That was interesting. Well, if they can deal with how young I look, I might be up for a callback. But I'd be surprised. This is hard. Well, it was fun while it lasted. At least I got to read. And I didn't end up entirely humiliating myself, so that's a good thing. After hearing about getting the callback: Holy crap! I did it! I can't believe I got the callback! I might actually get this part. I never considered myself right for it, but I must be in the running! Wow. Wow. This is awesome. I am happy. I wonder what the set will be like. Will I get to meet anyone famous? I wonder how hot we'll be when we're filming. I hope it's not too sunny that day. Man. I can't wait. Upon arrival at the callback: Uh oh. Look at that guy. He looks a lot more like a firefighter than I do. Wait - he has a different script. Whew. He's here for a different part. One competitor down. Wait - look at that guy. He's got a FDNY t-shirt. Shit. Why didn't I think of that? What am I doing in khakis? Firefighters don't wear khakis. I'm screwed. Plus, he's 35 or so. That's more like a firefighter. Crap. What are the lines again? Why do I keep forgetting that word? I'm screwed. After the callback: Could have been worse. So that's how it goes. As I always say, my hopes are high and my expectations are low. The experience alone was a blast, and I am so excited that I got this far. I hope it's not the only callback I ever get."

doc00357,2,"Here are 3 more movies that I recommend watching... 4. THE STORY OF RICKY (dir. Ngai Kai Lam) Anyone who thinks that Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is the worst movie ever made probably has not seen this ultimate cheesefest of a HongKong action film. This film is a classic... it is so bad that it is good, it makes PLAN 9 look like CITIZEN KANE. The original Chinese title of the movie is LI WANG, 'LI' as in strength and 'WANG' as in king, which refers to the main character, Ricky... (he is, you see, the King of Strength). Ricky gets sent to prison and goes around fighting all the corrupt guys who run the prison, and that sums up the entire story... But the ultra violent scenes in the film have to be seen to be believed. I don't really remember all the specific details of every fight, but I just know that they were incredibly (and probably unintentionally) funny. For instance, one of the big bosses in the prison is losing a fight with Ricky, and in an act of desperation he pulls out a knife and stabs himself in the gut, spilling his intestines. Ricky, being the hero, rushes to save his life, thinking that he is trying to commit suicide... but you see, the bad guy was bluffing, and once Ricky gets near enough, he grabs his own intestines and strangles Ricky with them, and he lets out this evil laugh and says to Ricky ""Ha ha... Ni Bei Pian Le...""(trans. ""Haha... Sucker...""). I remember this scene so well as it has been burned forever in my brain due to its unbelievable stupidity and cheesiness. (One of Peter Jackson's earlier movies, BRAINDEAD, a zombie send-up, was a huge film-festival hit purely on the basis that it delivered entertaining cheesy violence and it was one of the first films I'd seen that used ultra violent scenes as comedic tools. This success was again replicated by the Spierig Brothers' first feature film THE UNDEAD... it's such a pity that THE STORY OF RICKY was not entered in any film-fests...) This film is extremely hard to find, so if you happen to come across a VCD of this movie... BUY IT!!! Do not hesitate! Trust me, there is no other film like it. 5. PI (dir. Darren Aronofsky) Before I talk about this movie, let me talk about this tutor I had in my first year of Uni. This guy was way cool, coz he was different from all the other tutors who kept talking about informing your design thematic with a unifying philosophy. Most of them liked to refer to Heidegger and Barthes when explaining their architectural designs. But when I asked this guy what was his underlying thematic when he created his designs, instead of going on about how the interior spaces are a reflection of the language of human emotions which are a contradiction of the meaning of existence and the search for whatever crap some German guy went on about... he just said that the design was kind of influenced by cyber-punkish aesthetics... Okay, I may sound like an ignorant dumb ass here, but why can't design be that straightforward instead of having the need to relate it to what some dead guys said years ago? Isn't that just an exercise to make yourself appear more intelligent so that you can impress or put down people who have no idea what you are talking about? Anyway, this tutor is quite a film buff (he does 3D animation work for short films as a sideline), and we talked a lot about all the movies that we liked. He recommended this movie, PI, about a mathematician who is on the verge of reducing chaos theory into a single formula, which has the potential to unlock the universal patterns found in nature and thus predict the future. Unavoidably, he becomes involved in a struggle for power between capitalists who want the formula to predict the stock market, and some rabbis who want to unlock the secrets of the Torah.(Apparently the Hebrew language is based on a numerological system) This movie came out around the same time as the first MATRIX, and we were discussing the similarities that they had in the opening sequences. Where the MATRIX had this screensaver thing with the green code that flooded the screen while PI flooded the screen with the value of pi, which goes on forever. When I compared these two movies together, I kind of realised how full of shit the MATRIX was, I mean, for the MATRIX opening sequence, they basically appropriated Katakana alphabets and fashioned them into this supposed new code that the MATRIX is built on. That's just trying to look cool without any substance, because they never explain how computer code evolved from a base number system into a pictorial alphabet system (which I think is quite impractical to use as code). (I hope that doesn't sound too nerdy.) The point is, PI doesn't go for cheap aesthetics like the MATRIX, which is just a movie about making cool looking scenes with 3D graphics.(Okay, some of you may say that I'm a hypocrite after what I said about architectural design being too weighed down with unnecessary philosophical ideas, but I think it's different when it comes to film, because films fall flat and fail to engage when there isn't enough substance, but buildings are not held together by notions and ideas) This film is Darren Aronofsky's first feature and after this one he made REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, about drug addicts, which I also recommend. I'm a big fan of Darren now... it was disappointing to hear that he is no longer gonna do the BATMAN: YEAR ONE movie, that would definitely have kicked some serious ass. 6. LONE WOLF AND CUB - WHITE HEAVEN IN HELL (dir. Yoshiyuki Kuroda) This is the culminating movie in a series of six films made in the early seventies based on Kazuo Koike's smash hit samurai manga series, LONE WOLF AND CUB. These comics were translated and published in the US in the late eighties with the covers drawn by Frank Miller, who also wrote the introduction for every issue. I was a huge fan of these comics when I was in Primary School, and when I first heard that they made live action movies of them, with the screenplays written by Kazuo Koike himself, I almost shat myself. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I have a personal bias, it is a huge thrill for me to see the manga in live action. LONE WOLF AND CUB is basically about Ogami Itto(the Lone wolf), a former executioner for the shogun, now a wandering samurai for hire, on a bloody journey to revenge. Accompanying him is his infant son, Daigoro(the cub), the last surviving member of his family who were killed by a rival clan of samurai, the Yagyus. The Yagyus had Ogami Itto framed in order to take over the much sought after job of the shogunate executioner. (This premise, in my opinion, was ripped off in ROAD TO PERDITION, also a movie based on a comic book about a Mafia Hitman who was framed and forced to go on the run as a gun for hire with his son, the last surviving member of his family.) The series of six LONE WOLF movies (also known as the BABY CART series), had very similar storylines... Itto basically roams around, pushing his son in a baby cart and kills people for money. At the same time, he has to fend off assassins who are sent by the Yagyus. The fight scenes are terrific, especially when you see all the hidden weapons that have been engineered into the seemingly innocent baby cart... but the movies do get a bit repetitive once you've seen four or five of them. However, the last movie redeems the whole series as this one has the most incredible climactic fight scene I've ever seen in any movie... After killing off every single one of the assassins sent by the Yagyus, Itto now has to face the remaining members of the Yagyu clan, all 5000 of them. This showdown was shot on location at a breathtaking snow-covered mountainous region and the scene where 5000 extras charge down towards Itto and his baby cart is equally breathtaking(especially considering that no CG was used unlike the LORD OF THE RINGS and MATRIX RELOADED). Another thing that I liked about the movies is the casting of the role of Ogami Itto. In the comics, Itto is drawn as square jawed, handsome and heroic, but the guy who plays him in the movies is an overweight, middle aged man who looks a lot like Anthony Wong. This allows the character in the movies to shift between two personas effectively, one is that of an innocent looking father with his son, and the other is a ruthless warrior with cold, intense eyes."
doc00358,1,"For myself, the historicity of a representation of a figure such as Jesus or the Buddha is completely irrelevant. What matters to me are the words and the act(s). My own research has revealed that Gibson intended to film an interpretation, albeit one that is more ""gritty"" and ""violent."" In that sense -- and in that sense only -- it seems that the film can be tested against realism. In terms of event and image, it is, like all films, a personal visual exploration. As Ebert often says, a movie is not about what it is about, but how it is about it. As a sidenote, there is a curious need in modern society to equate ""veracity"" with ""truth,"" as if they have anything at all to do with each other. At least once a year, a newsmagazine devotes a cover story to the ""real Jesus,"" the ""real Muhammed,"" the ""real Whoever"" -- as if evidence matters in the search for truth. Evidence yields nothing but data. Data has its uses, and for many from the 18th century Enlightenment onward, its presence can evoke deep satisfaction -- but in the great cocktail party of the universe, beyond nodding to each other at the cheese table, data and faith have very little to talk about."

Yes, I have been unsuccessfully trying to curb my food intake which is just a phrase better than the word - DIET. Short-term reasoning = important magazine shoot in two days. Long-term reasoning = I just wanna look good can? :P Before I get anyone riled up about how women love to say that they're fat when in fact they're not, let me just state that I ain't fat. Like what a dear friend would say, I'm just FUZZY around the edges. Hmm. Sounds better than my usual nicked punchline, ""I AIN'T FAT, I'M JUST BIG-BONED!"" Fine, I'm just a funky chunky munky. Heh. I've come to realise that being happy with yourself exudes that certain sense of confidence. Not too pompous but just that simple satisfaction about who you really are. In this blood-sucking industry I swim in, it's been a tough battle to keep up that confidence. Especially when majority of the masses can be so utterly judgemental. As one prominent make-up artist would put it, ""WAH, it's you ah...I thought who's this auntie that just walked in leh...why you so fat now?"" Thanks but no thanks. Sheesh. I'm phat like dat aight! Even when I was in my illest state on a hospital bed, I was still fairly bulky. So why the hell is everyone giving me pressure to be a skinny ass? It's no wonder I love shopping for clothes in the States. I'm considered a PETITE over there. Woohoo! Feel good time. Moreover, they give allowance to broad shoulders like mine in their tee shirt cuts. Unlike the usual small shoulders and short torso pieces we have here. Get real, priz. Nonetheless, I have been rather fortunate at this time of my life. I've managed to secure most of my jobs due to my spunky personality and bursting talent rather than how I look. So they say lah. At least there are still those who see through the facade of twiggy glory. Hurrah. Well, I am now awaiting good news with bated breath for my next job based on that presumption. Non-grago, non-modelle vee jey....Hmm, I might be the first-ever! Ha! Wish me luck! :) In the meantime, it's back to the gymmy now that my dates are more flexi. Yoga anyone?"

It rained today, just as I'd predicted, at the time I predicted. Can be used as a good evangelical tool. I reminded Ziz and he told me ""By the power of God almighty"". I don't know what to say to that, but I wholeheartedly agree. I watched the passion today. Was uncharacteristically detached during the course of the gorish binge. Wouldn't actually call it a binge, but it makes me sound clever. I did flinch and occasionally scream at the screen for them to ""STOP HITTING HIM ALREADY!!!"" MY GOD IS GOOD and he did that for me.

doc00364,6,"I don't know how men can be such jerks. I hate men. I guess being raised by women and not growing up with a father has something to do with it. Especially after being lied to about his existence. For some reason unbeknownst to me, I was afraid to ask my mom about my dad, and she never talked about him. Ever. I asked my aunts and cousins who he was. My cousins didn't know. One Aunt told me he was a no-good drunk and I didn't want to know him. Another Aunt told me he was dead. I never asked about him again. I always wondered why I didn't have a dad, and was ashamed to tell anyone. Back in the 60's it was taboo to not have a dad. Especially with the Irish Catholics. (My mom stopped taking me to church at an early age for some reason...) I was a secret. It was heartbreaking to see other kids with their dads. I remember when I was 11 years old, and my Mom and I moved to another relatives house. I ended up making a friend with a kid named Dominic. We became best friends. He was my only friend. One night he started bragging about where his dad worked and telling me about how strong his dad was. He then asked me where my dad worked. I told him I didn't have a dad. This blew him away. His jaw dropped, his eyes nearly popped out of his head, and he said to me, ""That means you're a Bastard! You're a son of a bitch!"" He said he had to go, and never talked to me again. (I believe his family was devout Catholic.) This shocked me. The reality of the situation really started to hit me that night. I was something that people are afraid of. Not having a dad was a lot more serious than I thought. I don't know why he called me a son of a bitch, and I later found out what a bastard was. I never again told any kids I didn't have a father. I lied several times to other kids about my dad after that episode. I found out I was half Italian when I was 16. I managed to lie through school saying I was 100% Irish. I finally asked my Aunt. When I was 23 my uncle asked me if my mom ever told me who my dad was. (my uncle will be another post; a big post) I told him no. He must've said something to my mom and she called me and asked me to meet her. I was shocked to learn that he actually lived about 2 miles from where I grew up (age 11-18), and he had a wife and 4 daughters. Apparently, his wife and daughters didn't know about me. After I found out, I got really drunk with my friends and went to his house. I knocked on the screen door and his wife was sitting on the chair in the living room. She looked up at me and said ""What do you want!"" I told her I'm (my mom)'s son, and I'm here to see Joe (my father ). My father came around the bar, stirring a drink, looking at the door. He had an older couple behind him. He came up to the screen door and we just looked into each other's eyes for what seemed like an eternity. They were my eyes . I was looking at my eyes . It was so strange. He finally said, ""Can you come back another time? I have company."" I said ""Sure. I just wanted to stop by and say hello."" I turned around and left. Well, I guess I let the cat out of the bag. I heard his wife divorced him after that. I didn't want that to happen. It just did. Revenge of the bastard son. That was back in 1983. You know he still never tried to contact me. I guess someone will tell me when he dies. I never got the balls to contact my sisters. I don't know them, and I don't know if they know about me. If so, do they hold me responsible for their parents divorce? I don't remember the 4 girls from school. 2 are older than me and 2 are younger than me. I guess I never met them. I am the secret. I am the bastard son."

Our priority right now is to send the existing programmers for events and competitions. Taking new programmers at this stage will do nobody any good. You may still apply for Senior Programming but be assured that unless you're really brilliant, your chances of getting in are low. Junior Programming Since QBASIC is no longer taught at Class VIII level (instead Visual Basic is taught), the Programming Department of Exun is planning to conduct a Logic Test for Class VIII very soon, from which promising students will be trained in QBASIC. Software Display Students who have made software in Visual Basic or Visual C++ (any software with a GUI) are invited to come and show their software to us (see below). We're looking for good software that can be sent for Software Display competitions. Senior Quizzing The toughest amongst them all.

doc00372,6,"...*L*...some crazy bullshit. My time was spent Saturday evening in Window Rock AZ in hopes of seeing/hearing Soulfly perform. This wasn't the case. The outcome was ""Fuck Soulfly!"" I don't know what to say about these type of performances on the reservation with major headlining artists such as Soulfly or any other ""big named"" bands. Personally I don't think they should have these types of events on the reservation...should stick with LOCAL acts only. Mainly because the lil towns in which they have these events are small, not enough audiences (unless of course it is known that there will be a huge audience). Peeps have to come from distance towns just to see these acts (three hours for us). I feel major artists should stick with cities or bigger towns, just because they have the numbers to fill venues, etc. That's just my opinion. Well I had no feelings whatsoever about what had happened. My thoughts were ""I'll see them in the future."" And despite what others feel/think about Soulfly (out of those who witnessed what happened), I still think they are a great band and will continue to enjoy their music. Oh, and at least I got half of my money back :P While we were there, we ran into Hear Lies Treachery and Swell Chemistry. What's cool about running into them was....well at first I recognized the natives in the group...I was like ""hey, you’re *insert band name here*"" for both bands...and the entire band turns around and are...heck, helluva cool, shaking hands and talkative...unlike other bands where your like ""hey, you’re..."" and only one of the members turns and are like ""hey."" So yea, that was cool. I think both performed a great set...better than the rest I think. There's a lot more to mention about this event...but I won't go into details.

My position is similar to what yours was, but there is no question in my mind that I’m leaving for school. I’m also not thinking of him as being the one I want to marry, even though our kids would be so cute (he doesn’t think this talk is funny). The biggest plus is if we break up this way, we’ll still be friends. I’m going to cry, or maybe just tear up a little. Marcus can’t take his work anymore and has a sure thing waiting for him in Minneapolis. The city has impressed him. However, I don’t want to leave without knowing which school I’ll be attending.

doc00377,6,"urlLink Burning books in the news (be sure to note the name of the preacher and the church). As a writer, I wholeheartedly support churches burning books. One of two situations must apply - either the church ordered its parishioners to steal the books, in which case I can savor the irony, or they used their tithings to buy the freaking things, thus supporting the industry they attack. Book burning is a good metaphor for religion - flame and noise and hatred and finger-pointing with no real impact on their appointed enemies. Besides, they need their enemies. Without them they'll have to point those fingers at themselves. I think I'll dedicate my first novel to Satan in the hopes that many religions will want to burn it. If any religious representatives want to place an early order, urlLink e-mail me and let me know. I'll see that your church gets a good discount based on volume."

If you would call me on the phone, I would have absolutely nothing to say. It's true..I's happened several times already this week. Anyway, I really love learning about shit from the days of yore, and I have spent the past few days trying to find 1890's newspaper advertisements about tea and women's culture for a paper. I came across the coolest source, an online archive of Harper's Weekly, an old society-driven newspaper now turned magazine, with some great stuff. Also, for anyone that likes to drink tea, I highly recommend black ceylon tea flavored with rose. I purchased some from an international market, and it is my new favorite beverage. My box of tea is from Sri Lanka, and I'm not sure if the rose flavor is done often in American-produced teas. I also learned that putting a cinnamon stick in a cup of tea is a nice alternative to using sugar. Ok, I'll stop being 90 years old now."
doc00379,1,"Last night was very...interesting. Dennis, Mistress' boyfriend...for now. This morning she was talking to him and found out HE HAS A DAUGHTER WITH ANOTHER GIRL that wasn't even his gf at the time or something like that whole Usher deal. Hah! But he should have told her sooner. She said she will break up with him tomorrow. Last night...I....I was lonely, though she was there, because she has Dennis and said I wasn't allowed to kiss her and I wanted to just hold her so bad and after a while I just kissed her. She kissed me back but I'm like, I'm sorry. She's like don't be. Then I did it again and she stopped me and was like ""WhY? WHY do you want to kiss me?"" And as Matt says, you dont ask questions like that to the Megan. Whatever. So stupid little Megan went downstairs and filled an empty bottle with some of Dad's wine and SHIT IT BURNS but idiotic Megan got herself drunk and prozaced up and such. I don't know. I'm all like....blah. So I talked to Matt and Fitzy on the phone all night and just rambled and I didn't puke!! :-D cuz I wanted to. This morning I haven't eaten really. I tried multiple times. My head hurts and my ears ache and I feel like shit and I'm tired and we watched LOSER which is one of those good movies that put you in one of those moods like...I am going to change something.

doc00381,3,"My friend Liza Galon sent me this, very nice... My mother was a fanatic about public toilets. As a little girl, she'd bring me in the stall, teach me to wad up toilet paper and wipe the seat. Then, she'd carefully lay strips of toilet paper to cover the seat. Finally, she'd instruct, 'Never, never sit on a public toilet seat.' And she'd demonstrate 'The Stance,' which consisted of balancing over the toilet in a sitting position without actually letting any of your flesh make contact with the toilet seat. But by this time, I'd have gotten wet down my leg. And we'd go home. That was a long time ago. Even now in our more mature years, The Stance is excruciatingly difficult to maintain when one's bladder is especially full. ""When you have to go to a public bathroom, you find a line of women that makes you think there's a half-price sale on Mel Gibson's underwear in there. So, you wait and smile politely at all the other ladies, also crossing their legs and smiling politely. And you finally get closer. You check for feet under the stall doors. Every one is occupied. Finally, a stall door opens and you dash, nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall. You get in to find the door won't latch. It doesn't matter. You hang your purse on the door hook, yank down your pants and assume 'The Stance.' ""Relief. More relief. Then your thighs begin to shake. You'd love to sit down but you certainly hadn't taken time to wipe the seat or lay toilet paper on it, so you hold 'The Stance' as your thighs experience a quake that would register an eight on the Richter scale. To take your mind off it, you reach for the toilet paper. The toilet paper dispenser is empty. Your thighs shake more. ""You remember the tiny tissue that you blew your nose on-that's in your purse. It would have to do. You crumble it in the puffiest way possible. It is still smaller than your thumbnail. ""Someone pushes open your stall door because the latch doesn't work and your purse whams you in the head. ""Occupied!"" you scream as you reach out for the door, dropping your tissue in a puddle and falling backward, directly onto the toilet seat. ""You get up quickly, but it's too late. Your bare bottom has made contact with all the germs and life forms on the bare seat because YOU never laid down toilet paper, not that there was any, even if you had enough time to. And your mother would be utterly ashamed of you if she knew, because her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because, frankly, 'You don't know what kind of diseases you could get.' ""By this time, the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is so confused that it flushes, sending up a stream of water akin to a fountain and then it suddenly sucks everything down with such force that you grab onto the toilet paper dispenser for fear of being dragged to China. At that point, you give up. ""You're soaked by the splashing water. You're exhausted. You try to wipe with a Chicklet wrapper you found in your pocket then slink out inconspicuously to the sinks. ""You can't figure out how to operate the sinks with the automatic sensors, so you wipe your hands with spit and a dry paper towel and walk past a line of women, still waiting, cross-legged and unable to smile politely at this point. ""One kind soul at the very end of the line points out that you are trailing a piece of toilet paper on your shoe as long as the Mississippi River! You yank the paper from your shoe, plunk it in the woman's hand and say warmly, 'Here. You might need this.' ""At this time, you see your spouse, who has entered, used and exited his bathroom and read a copy of 'War and Peace' while waiting for you. ""'What took you so long?' he asks, annoyed. This is when you kick him sharply in the shin and go home. ""This is dedicated to all women everywhere who have ever had to deal with a public toilet. And it finally explains to all you men what takes us so long."" Other noteworthy immortal words of wisdom from my mom included: (1) Pinch your nose every evening so that it would grow to be aquiline (didn't work). (2) Never mix drinks. (Ignored up to the point when I woke up one morning after and thought my head would fall off.) (3) ""Nice girls don't smoke."" (No comment.) (4) Make sure your underwear has no holes on it; you never know when you'll meet with an accident. (5) Don't wear pencil skirts when your behind is completely flat! (Also ignored.) (6) No matter how pretty or smart you are, there'll always be someone prettier or smarter. (7) The fate of a plain woman is often envied by a pretty woman. (8) Never say, of these waters I will not drink. (9) If you don't stop frowning, your face will freeze and you'll be ugly forever. (10) Never go out into the sun without an umbrella or headgear; you don't see farmers in bikinis, do you? (11) If you don't stop showing off how smart you are, no one will ever marry you."

Nasa ikatlong shot na ako ng Silk Panty at bumubwelo para sa straight na Orgasm sa hamon ni Manong Bartender. Umuulan. Sarado ang ibang bars at ang Wave ay may private party. Masyadong malayo ang Mangas sa Station 1 at medyo lahat na yata ng tao sa Summer Place ay kilala ko na. Napagkamalan nga akong naka-Party nung ibang Americans kase sobrang lupit ang hataw ko sa sayaw kagabi. Kaya napatambay ako sa bar ng tito ko. At andun ka, kasama ang bote ng Red Horse, iba mong mga kaibigan, at ang billiard table. Ilang tinginan na rin ang nagpalitan sa atin bago ka nagkaroon ng lakas ng loob na magpakilala. Okay lang naman. Hindi nagkakalayo ang edad natin at pareho naman tayo nasa mood makipagkwentuhan. San ba tayo nakarating? Sa mga idealisms natin, sa buhay mo, sa buhay ko, sa mga katarantaduhan natin, sa Boracay, kahit yung mga gagong tanong na ""If the seal is broken, will you accept it?"". Ewan basta ang gaan na talaga ng loob ko sa yo. Hinatid mo pa ako sa cabin ko nung matapos ang kwentuhan ng alas-tres ng umaga. Nakakantiyawan pa nga yung mga barkada mo. Akala ko hanggang dun nalang. Yung isang usap ng isang gabing walang magawa. Kinabukasan, habang nagpapahenna ako sa likod bigla ka nalang dumating at hinalikan ang pisngi ko. Close ba tayo? Pero natuwa ako kase kanina pa talaga kita hinahanap nung nasa Talipapa ako at sa d'Mall. Nakalimutan ko kase kung san ka naka-stay kaya hindi kita ma-hunting at ma-spy on. Kaya nagulat ako. At natuwa. Sabay abot ka sa Watermelon-Mango Shake without milk na kinuwento ka sayo na the best ang lasa. Sabi mo hindi mo type kaya binibigay mo sakin. Ok lang. Kinilig parin ako kase yung effort na subukan mo yung shake na dun ko rin din natikman, tumalon na ang puso ko. Sabi mo astig yung henna ko na spiral backbone sa likod. Sabi mo swerte naman nung nag-hehenna sakin. Charing ka talaga. Kagabi kapa. Ang haba na ng buhok. Magkasama na tayo buong maghapon. Nakatambay tayo sa cabin ko. Ikaw nagsu-sway ng hammock ko, sinamahan mo akong bumili ng souvenirs, at kahit ayaw mong mag-swimming dahil may sipon at ubo kana kakanight swimming, ikaw nalang yung nagbantay ng sarong ko habang ako'y nagpapakaligaya kasama ang konting lumot at ang maputi at pinong buhangin ng Aklan. Binilan mo pa nga ako ng isang Pawa Necklace yung may red na string. Kase sabi mo bagay sa kulay ng pisngi ko. Mahal na yata kita. Nung gabi, naglakad tayo sa Cafe del Sol, sabi mo kase may sasabihin ka kaya sumama ako. Tama ka: Kung nasa paraiso ka tulad ng Boracay, nakakalimutan mo ang lahat. Nawawala pandalian ang mga problemang laging nandyan kung gigising ka sa isang ordinaryong araw sa Maynila. Na parang lahat pwedeng magyari sa lugar na yon. Magical nga, yun ang sabi mo. Sumangayon naman ako sa iyo. Kase lahat yan nararamdaman ko. Sabi mo isa akong taong kakaiba. Bihira lang ang mga taong may takbo ng pag-iisip na katulad ko. Na malamang kahit hindi mo hingin ang number ko, gagawa ka ng paraan para mahanap ako. Napangiti lang ako. Eto na naman... Hinatid mo ako sa cabin ko sabay halik sakin. Kung pwede lang talaga, sabi mo. Oo nga kung pwede lang. Kaya lang ayoko na maging third party ulit. Parang nakakasawa na. Sabi mo, kung wala lang siya, di imposibleng ako nasa buhay mo nga. Napangiti lang ako sabay pasok sa pinto. Hanggang dito nalang muna siguro. Kung tayo, tayo. Pero hindi nga pwede. Dahil maputol man ang kamay mo na may singsing na simbolo ng pangako mo, nanjan parin ang alaala ng tanging nilalang na makakaramdam ng habangbuhay sa piling mo."

doc00387,1,"Greetings all! I am glad to see that the postings continued while I was gone - I had a good time this morning reading them. I still haven't gotten through all of them, but I shall! LOL Then, I have to tackle some other forums... I won't be bored for a while! To end the suspense, my precious Petunia is doing fine. For those who wonder, her real name is Rhiannon but I shall continue calling her my Precious Petunia until she objects to it. :-) We were released from the hospital late Friday night. We haven't done really anything at all - Petunia is jaundiced so we have a home health nurse who stops by every day to take a blood sample to check on her bilirubin levels. She sleeps night and day on a light bed that fits inside her bassinet. This is NOTHING like those monstrous light tables found in hospital nurseries where the baby has to be naked and blindfolded - this looks like a copy machine with a soft mylar top where the baby lies (not unlike a hammock). She wears a paper outfit on it that looks somewhat like a cradleboard that a western NA child would wear (sorry, lack of better description) but is loose, and she is velcroed onto the light bed. I will post a picture when I get them developed. Her levels went up on Saturday but have come very slowly down and she has finally stopped losing weight. Things are starting to look very, very good. We had an incredible adventure but I am glad it is finally all over now. Thank you all for the kind wishes and comments."

doc00390,4,"Hey, I hope you all had a fantastic break... I know I did. I read ""Catcher In The Rye"" over the break because there are a lot of references to it in other media sources...Six Degrees of Seperation and Chasing Amy are two movies that the book influences, but I never really felt the significance of it. It's a book narrated by a student our age about himself. He's having trouble dealing with his life- he makes references to suicide, he's kind of cynical, thinks everyone's a ""phony,"" as well as intermitently dealing with the death of his brother. It's written coloquially (like Huck Finn only NINETEEN 50's), and it's kind of funny at times because Holden (the narrator) is such an oddball character, but it's nothing that's really going to change my life. If you're disconnected with your surroundings and like a straightforward read, you could identify with ""Catcher,"" or if you're Thomas, and are rooting for the nonconformist protagonist, you might really identify. I guess it just wasn't what I expected, but I AM looking forward to ""Of Mice and Men."" Love, Rob"

doc00392,2,"For those looking for a great day of basketball, look no further than the championships in the Peekskill Recreation Basketball League. The championships will be held at Lepore Park Friday, Aug. 20 at 5 p.m. In case of rain, they will be moved to Oakside Elementary School. Four divisions will be hosting championships and they are 10-and-under, 12-and-under, 14-and-under and 16-and-under. The games are scheduled to be in that order. P.J. Tinsley has run the league for the longest time and the success of the Peekskill Red Devils is proof of what he does is something special. Those like Peekskill boys basketball coach Lou Panzanaro and Rashard Turner, who was a star guard on the 2002 Peekskill Red Devil squad that went the state finals, have credited Tinsley with being an vital part of the Peekskill dynasty. Tinsley is a vital part of it because without him running a league to help develop younger players, there are no trips to the Westchester County Center in February/March. So those of you who want to catch a glimpse of the Red Devil future, the championships at Lepore Park are the place to be. Mike Sabini-914-582-8703-msabini@mail.com"

doc00405,3,"Still sleepless... Holy insomnia batman, will I ever get to sleep again through the night? Not any time soon I am afraid... My insomnia is back on the high frequency end again. I have had it for the last 3 to 4 years and have had bouts like I am now allot, sleep 2 hours, up for 2 hours, sleep and hour, up for an hour, and maybe sleep another hour. This isn't healthy and will catch up to me. I asked my endrochronologist, he claims the hormones shouldn't do that. I am more in the thinking of stress. I am still trying to catch up on bills, I am getting used to a new job, and Saturday wasn't a good day at 20. On the way out a friend who I care for slapped/grabbed my ass in front of Co. This has been hard on her as it is, she isn't even comfortable enough to call me by my new name. And here is this more male than female guy touching her husband in a way men touch women, not cool at all. I won't get into too much, but it ruined the whole night for us. We still sometimes show our love for each other the way we did in our married life, even though it is much different now. Mr. Happy aka my little birth defect is non operational due to all the hormones, so I can't do nothing, but there is something so erotic about getting someone else there. Needless to say the whole incident took away her mood, and has her reconsidering going back. This isn't a good thing, I was hoping that Co's presence might bring others out of the shadows and into the support group, it will take awhile, but it is a possibility. I won't though put Co through needless pain to do it, and if my friends actions hurt her like that, they might not be friends for long. In one of my short periods of sleep I had a dream. I was in some sort of college for only the folks I went to elementary school with. It was weird to say the least, but hey it's a dream. So anyway I'm at my desk waiting for the prof to come in and my old buddy Lewis Eaton, the one who hit me w/ the line drive in little league in the jimmy, calls me snottily by my old name. I freaked out, threw aside my desk and chair, his when he got startled, backed him up to the wall, and jacked his ass up by the throat. I asked him if he had an issue with my new look, he meekly said no. I squeezed harder as he turned purple and told him not to mess with me again. I threw him to the ground in a heap. I kicked him in the stomach for good measure and as I looked down it was no longer Lewis, but my good friend who pissed me and co off at the meeting. What it means I don't know? I know my friend reads this, I know her to be a good person. I have left out her name deliberately, she knows what she did no need to humiliate her. I hope she realizes actions have consequences, and to just take that extra second to think shit through. Or else I will jack her up against the wall too. She is a little bit taller and I can't exactly reach her throat, so I will have to find another handle. I am not a violent person until provoked to be so. I don't let people push me around much, and I have zero tolerance when it comes to someone hurting my family and friends. I hope I don't have to show the ugly side of the Ash in awake time any time soon. Love to all, and take care. urlLink postCount('108842123690963050'); | urlLink postCountTB('108842123690963050');"

doc00407,1,"I saw Main Hoon Na for the second time and still wondered why hasn’t anybody spoken about Suniel Shetty and his ‘acting’. For those who haven’t seen the film, he is this hardcore villain who gets beaten (not beaten up), in the end by the hero. He isn’t an anti-hero kind but a real villain and he does a pretty convincing job of it too. From being a non-actor to actually doing a good job of beating up Shahrukh Khan, he is good, despite the tacky blue lens in his eye and that horrid wig. So there is no mention of him anywhere in the papers or magazines or anywhere at all. Its’ sad because in this film, he has taken a risk of experimenting with the character and he has succeeded. Personally, I feel he makes a better villain than a hero. His dialogue delivery sucks otherwise as a hero because he doesn’t have a deep voice but a rather thin one. Still, it works in this character. He has, definitely, improved by way of acting as compared to others who go around claiming that they are ‘actors’. I liked him in this film and hope that people take a second look at him and say something."

doc00413,3,"I've enjoyed the ease of blogging that I've experienced since I switched to Blogger. It's not too simple, but not too advanced either. It works, and I like it. Especially since Movable Hype Type has become such a pain in the neck. Along with Blogger, another thing that I've discovered is w.bloggar. It's a tool (that many of you already know about and use) that allows you to post to a blog without having to access the main interface. It would have been great to use with the previous versions of Movable Type, back when it was free and user friendly. Now, with Blogger, I can post via w.bloggar, and not have to log in to the Blogger ""Dashboard"" every time I want to post. One thing, however, is that I have yet to actually post using w.bloggar. Sure, I've used it to type up a few entries, but I haven't used it to actually publish a post to my blog. That will be the true test of this thing, I suppose. And now that I've bored you to death, I think I'll be moving on. Peace, AtG"
doc00414,1,"Bello, it's 8:22 and I haven't done ANY of my homework from spring break. okay, I didn't really have that much homework. I just have to do some French worksheets, study for my French test, and gather some things for my biology project. The best part is is that it's now dark out and possibly raining *crosses fingers, please rain tomorrow, please rain* this means I'm going to have to explore my backyard in the dark, bello right? right. But in other news, I've finished my painting, this makes me happy, i never finish ANYTHING, seriously, I can do a lot of things, but it's really hard for me to finish something. If you ever investigate my room there are dozens of half finished projects that are just gathering dust. I partially blame my laziness and partially blame my fear of ending things. I don't fear dying, i just fear endings, does that make sense? I don't really care if it does, because I know what I mean. Anyway, this is the final product of my painting, I'm aware it's pretty shitty, but a lot of emotion went into it. ""better than a knife right?"""

When it first came out me and two friends went to see it and didn't like it...we threw M&M's at the movie screen and stuck gum to the bottom of our chairs...we called it ""Mr. Hollands Dopus"" if I recall correctly. Then we went to the hospital to see my mom and my grandma and pulled our pants down in some thorny bushes to moon my mom and ended up falling over in them...hmmm...now that I'm much older and a little more mature (not toooooo much more mature though) I think I might be able to appreciate it a little more. I finished my book!!! It's the first new book I've read in foooorever! I love reading, and since I haven't had any money to buy new books, I've been recycling through all my old books that I've read a million times. Last time we were at Costco though, Deane told me he was going to buy urlLink Episode 2 , so I said--fine, I'm getting a new book then! So I got urlLink White Oleander .

doc00417,1,"Dear Friends, Well, what can I say. It just wouldn't be a ""Dear Friends"" if you my life didn't hand me out lemons by the barrel full. I am actually convinced that I live underneath a lemon tree and everytime a ray of sunshine shines thru to my little meaningless life another lemon magically grows in that spot. So what do I do? I mean truthfully, what do I do. Let's analyze the situation shall we. I can complain, cry, moan, weep, bitch, yell, scream, guilt, or anything else that would grab someone's attention. But, I don't want to do that. Infact, that is what this letter started out as. A cry for help...actually more than a cry for help. It was a cry to realize that I exist and moreover, it was an attempt to force you into being interested in me. See that is my problem. Selfishness mixed with Loneliness and you get Anthony. A guy who can't stand to sit in a house by himself all night long so he secretly draws up fake fate. Yup. Fake Fate. You know when you meet someone and you instantly know that you are gonna have a long-lasting relationship with them. Whether it be friendship, love or otherwise. There is always that feeling that you have. You know the one. Right before you go to bed. Where you know that this day is a special day in the story that is your life. If your life was a WB t.v. show this would be the season premier. Everyone knows the feeling that I am talking about because everyone has had it at one point or another. (In which has probably led you to your plans this Thursday.....no.....we won't mention what day that is) But, me? Oh how I long for that feeling. And oh how easy it is for me to fraudently create it. Against Fate. Fate says, ""this isn't supposed to happen."" But, I say, ""YES IT IS!"" because I yearn to have that feeling so badly. I am human. I am not some weird crazy person who doesn't have feelings. I get lonely too. Just like everyone else. Whether this justifies my actions? I don't know. But, I do know that if life hand's you a lemon you should make lemonade.....but, sometimes.........I get sick of drinking lemonade. I want to drink what everyone else is drinking. I love you guys.

doc00421,4,"I'm going to officially backtrack. Mum's trying to talk to me but I can't hear her past music. I was born in Greensborough in Melbourne on the 21st of the 12th. I had a brother and a sister. 3 years later, there was another addition to my family - a younger brother. My dad moved us from Diamond Creek to Hurstbridge a few years later. I wagged school in prep, which I guess pinpointed the beggining of my problems with school. We moved to Ballarat where I started grade 3. My relatives all lived in Bendigo, except for an aunt that lived in Geelong with her family. I started at a catholic primary school. It was pretty sucky. Most of my friends were a year under me, but they were alright. I then continued onto a public high school - which was basically the drop kick school. I went there till year 9, where a week before I was to return to school from end of year holidays, my parents moved me and my sister to a very posh private school. It sucked for me. My sister already had tonnes of friends and I didn't know anyone. By this time we had found out that my older brother had cancer. The year he died, I started having trouble with school. Year 10. I stopped going to school gradully. It was 2003. Um. My parents then changed me to a tiny private catholic school. I didn't really go to it. That was probably the last time I went to school. Anyway, it's now this year, 2004, I haven't been to school, I haven't got a job. I'm still on anti-depressants. My parents are trying to convince me to go to a mental institution for evaluation because I might be a danger to myself, and I pretty much live on mohaa. I do however have a love for pets. I've had lots of lovebirds. All of them died, except for Phoenix who I realised back into the aviary. I miss Nacroth, the most tame bird I'll ever know who was eaten by our late cat. I have a kitten called Salsa, the love of my life. I have a hermit crab called Tex. Those are pretty much all my pets at this time. Alot has happened to me in my childhood which I'll leave out because the first person I ever told about that was my ex boyfriend, who happened to rip my heart out and stomp onto it. I have also been to germany with my sister for 3 weeks. 2001, Sept 12th, the day I found out about Sept 11."

doc00423,5,"i feel so burdened by sadness today. i watched a chinese show featuring a chinese comedy actress whose daughter was kidnapped, tortured, and raped. all because the actresss was famous and they wanted her money. as a mother, she was going insane wondering at what her child went through in her final days. it was as if someone stabbed a knife in her heart and left it there. this happened a year ago, and now she is trying to move on with life. she said something that only a woman with experience would admit: when you are a girl, you fantasize about storybook romances, and when they don't happen, you convince yourself that you can be a power woman, do anything and everything on your own; after you've been through the wind and the rain, you realize you still want a family to come home to. anyway, she is a very strong lady, and continues to make a living making other ppl laugh while her own life is marked by so much grief. yesterday, a very famous chinese actor, leslie cheung, who starred in highly artistic but controversial films such as farewell my concubine, jumped to his death from a hotel in hong kong with a note attached to his body saying that he was emotionally troubled. life imitating art, concludes the chinese newspaper. when i was little, i used to daydream all the time. if i watched a movie, i'd stand in front of the mirror, re-enacting my favorite scene as the leading lady, beautiful and strong, brave martyr of love. if i read a book, i'd use the plot as a template for my own adventures of the imagination. every night, these fantasies would carry me across the hazy line between consciousness and dreams. nowadays, i watch a movie, and i get disgusted by its stupid unreality. i open a book, and i fall asleep. i open my eyes, the race against time begins; i close my eyes, complete blankness...dreams may visit, but they never stay. the following is part of an email from suki, my roommate in hong kong: dear, have u read the news lately? u know there's a new kind of virus called atypical pnuemonia? it's really scary!!! people are wearing masks in the street now. i have always been thinking that one day in the world, people will need masks on in the street, because our earth is heavily polluted. but i've never thought that the day would come so soon. before, you look weird if you put on mask in the street, but now, u look weird if you don't. and all schools, including unviversities, are suspended for a week. if one is found to be infected, then all the people who have contacted him will be required to have check up everyday. his workplace will be thoroughly disinfected and his colleagues will be forced to take leave. and u know what, there's a residence building which has increasing number of residents found infected. now the people of that building are isolated in some countryside camps. they are not allowed to go anywhere. the government has never taken such action in history and schools are rarely announced to be suspended. what a world! i just stay at home these days if there's no need for me to go outside. how about the US? anymore large demonstrations against the war? is everything in order? can u tell me how americans view about this and the political instability if any. i am interested to know. the world is getting so terrible! let there be peace on earth! this was written by one of my favorite ppl in the world. she can be brutally honest, which is really funny, but also perceptively honest, which is enlightening. now she sounds scared, and i am very scared for her too."

Oh sure, I am a little low b/c of this whole Laura situation but that is about it. And who is he to say who is depressing? But whatever, I really don't care. Like Vic suggested, I'm just going to carry on with my life.&nbsp; Oh yeah, I emailed my sister last night about the USMC, and I basically shocked her. She called here at 8:00 am just to talk to me about it. And all she really said were the obvious things. Like the fact that I have to go to college, that USMC is the hardest branch to get into, and all that good stuff. But carrying on, my eye is fucking bothering me all to hell. Even these prescription eye drops don’t help, but oh well. I’ll live, lol. Yesterday I got my package from Jojo; complete with pics and 5 blank cds, 4 of which I could do w/e I want lol. But yeah, I still haven’t gotten a hold of Laura yet. Bummer/10 but there is nothing I can really do about it I might just end up emailing her about what’s been going through my mind, which most of you know by now.

Well, as you may have guessed, the book was about a vampire. Pretty twisted stuff, IMHO. Interesting views of detachment, sensation, and morality. In the context of this book, I think of myself as a vampire. I'm detached and far from real humanity. I see horrors or beauties and feel little if anything. And evil. Such evil I have done, but I won't be telling. It wasn't terribly illegal though. &nbsp; With my mental pysche appeased, let's turn to my auditory indulgences. While I've bought several new CDs, what I'm really listening to now is the soundtrack of The Matrix: Revolutions.&nbsp; Damn it's good. The lead singer of Hives once said that good rock is only sung in english. I reply that good classical music is only sung in anything but english. I'm not sure what Neodummerang is sung in, probably Hindi since it quotes the Upanshanids. But whatever it is, it's freekin' good. Buy this CD. No money? Sell your children, or steal one and sell him. *sigh* This CD reminds me why I like classical. You just can't get that mental rush from other genres. &nbsp; We're babysitting&nbsp;a small boy named Riley. By ""we"" I mean Kristen. I just love his blunt, innocent comments on life. He said I look like a girl (long hair) and I had a very messy room (self-explanatory). Ah, for such youthful exuburence. Wait, no, I don't want it. I like being tall and cynical of humans.

I have never seen someone's vacation pictures from there, but still for nearly a decade now I have be fascinated with this place and I have no idea how or if I will ever get over this obsession. Some say if I visit I will get over it, and I think if I visit I might want to stay. Which wouldn't be a bad thing, just an expensive thing.

doc00439,3,"From CNN: Unsolicited toe-licking would be banned in the Netherlands under a law sought by the Dutch Labor party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for female toes because he had committed no crime. A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained after women sunning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes. ""The officers had to let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is rather unusual but there is really nothing criminal about it,"" the spokesman said. Dutch press reports said the man, who is about 35, had been licking the toes of strangers for about three years but was only recently caught by police. Peter van Heemst, a Labor member of parliament, asked Christian Democrat Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner Friday to explain why Dutch laws forbid littering but not uninvited toe-licking. Van Heemst demanded an amendment prohibiting it. ""It is a violation of one's privacy and one's physical integrity,"" he told a local news agency. ""The norm... is that no one should touch your body if you haven't asked them first."" A spokesman for Donner said the minister could not immediately comment."

doc00443,5,"Hello. Welcome to Mathematical Solutions, where we believe that life is divided into two categories: math and bullshit , and we're interested in discussing both! Of course, by ""we"", I really mean me: my name is Rob Barry, and I'm a student of mathematics at the University of Miami . My brief career also includes such notable institutions as Haverford College and Florida International University . I enjoy life -- a bit too much. My enjoyment landed me in the hospital a few months back (18 to be precise), where I was told... well, that's skipping ahead a bit. No need to reveal the whole package in the first post! My interests are varied. I am currently studying the Riemann Hypothesis (what young mathematician isn't?), but my work there is a bit lacking, as I have yet to finish linear algebra. In fact, I've never produced an original thought in my life -- I'm still trying to catch up with all the thoughts these other people have already had. I'm also interested, when it comes to math, in fractal geometry . I've designed programs that evaluate both the Riemann Hypothesis as well as fractals, but they are written in variants of BASIC and are therefore painfully slow. When I was a young teen, I learned Turbo PASCAL -- little did I know that the wave of the future would be this C business! I don't know how to program C, but plan to learn. When I was a freshman in college, I tried to learn the theory of relativity , but really was only able to grasp the Lorentz Transformation . I believe that from the perspective of a photon, the universe is but a point ! Quite an intriguing idea, but I'm sure somebody else has already had it. I've very little to offer in the way of true knowledge: I proclaim to be versed in various subjects (history, literary theory, mathematics), but I'm not -- it's all a facade. Except I've lately discovered that one must actually pursue ones interests beyond the level of perusal, and thus I've begun my focus on mathematics. I find it fascinating that what originated as a way to determine quantities of real objects -- such as sheep -- has provided us with a framework for understanding the universe on the deepest level. Why should it be that the rules of addition should apply universally? The question sounds obvious; but the point is not. This is the area in which subjectivity and objectivity meet: when we have a subjective quantity of sheep, few, and we add another subjective quantity of sheep, also few, we have yet another subjective quantity: more. Thus, we can say that few plus few equals more. However, why should this always hold true? And when we break the sheep down from a subjective few to a quantified and objective five, then we can say that five sheep plus five sheep is always equal to more: ten sheep. Fingers retain this property, as do crates of marijuana, as do books and museums. All definable objects in the real world appear to be countable: that is, we can always have a given quantity of real objects, a quantity that can be fixed to infinite precision: we can have two and a half sheep, two and one third sheep, etc., and there is no apparent level of divisibility beyond which we can no longer alter the number of sheep by yet a smaller amount. The nature of matter probably does not retain this property: it is likely that there is a limit to divisibility; in fact, it is likely that these concepts do not apply at all on the most microscopic levels. And yet the rules for manipulating numbers appear to apply at all levels, and quite accurately! The rules appear to always be identical. What's the deal with that? It seems so basic and yet so complex. While I know that complexity is not necessarily dependent on size (see Stephen Wolfram 's massive new tome on the subject), I also feel that irreducibility of complexity should be something more apparent. Our brains are structured by the same set of rules, and yet we do not, inherently, seem to understand their more fundamental nature. I've hit an area on which I can not write with clarity, because my understanding breaks down. I've never thought it through. I'd like to know more about this quality of nature, and thus, I've devoted myself to this study of mathematics to the best of my ability. It takes a lot of work, I've discovered, work that I, for the most part, enjoy. I'd like to make a remarkable discovery, but I am, I hope, somewhat cognizant of the fact that many brilliant men have already trodden this path, and remarkable discoveries are few and far between. At most, I genuinely hope to be able to correspond with others regarding this subject. I hope to be able to post on this Blog frequently, and as a result, to attract some attention to myself -- positive or negative, I do not care -- which, I earnestly hope, will allow me the opportunity to communicate with others.

doc00445,2,"From Reuters: July 11, 2004 — WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior House Democratic lawmaker was skeptical on Sunday of a Bush administration idea to obtain the authority to delay the November presidential election in case of an attack by al Qaeda, U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the presidential election in case of such an attack, Newsweek reported on Sunday. ""I think it's excessive based on what we know,"" said Rep. Jane Harman of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, in a interview on CNN's ""Late Edition."" Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned last week that Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network want to attack within the United States to try to disrupt the election. Harman said Ridge's threat warning ""was a bust"" because it was based on old information. Newsweek cited unnamed sources who told it that the Department of Homeland Security asked the Justice Department last week to review what legal steps would be needed to delay the vote if an attack occurred on the day before or on election day. The department was asked to review a letter from DeForest Soaries, chairman of the new U.S. Election Assistance Commission, in which he asked Ridge to ask Congress for the power to put off the election in the event of an attack, Newsweek reported in its issue out on Monday. The commission was created in 2002 to provide funds to states to replace punch card voting systems and provide other assistance in conducting federal elections. In his letter, Soaries wrote that while New York's Board of Elections suspended primary elections in New York on the day of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, ""the federal government has no agency that has the statutory authority to cancel and reschedule a federal election."" Homeland Security Department spokesman Brian Rochrkasse told the magazine the agency is reviewing the matter ""to determine what steps need to be taken to secure the election."" Republican Rep. Christopher Cox of California, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that the idea of legislation allowing the election to be postponed was similar to what had already been looked at in terms of how to respond to an attack on Congress. ""These are doomsday scenarios. Nobody expects that they're going to happen,"" he said. ""But we're preparing for all these contingencies now."""

(Well yesterday and today) Well, Mike and Baron had plan to come see me but things didn't work out. Instead they were going to go to Pinellas but that didn't work out either. See Carolyn and Travis told Baron they were going to get Suzie. So Baron decided he wanted to stay to see her I guess so anywho they ended up not going anywhere. Just stayed home and ""hung out"". Well, they showed up at church in these outfits that sound wierd Baron was sporting a Vintage suit that was pink and green plad and Mike was sporting a Vintage suit that was corduroy. (I think I spelled that right) Some ppl thought they looked good others thought not so good. (I would have been in the 2nd group) After church they went home (Jean's) and changed, then Carolyn, Suzie, Mike and Baron decided they were going to go see ""The Little Black Book"". Well Mike was paying for Baron so when they went up to the window and asked for the tickets and the chic laughed in their faces. (I would have too) After the movie walking out to the car, a bum got 50 cents off Baron. Mike stayed at Jean's for the night then went home the next morning at around 11 and was pretty tired b/c he didn't go to bed until about 3 so he took a little nap. And that's all folks.....Hope you enjoy knowing what he does everyday!! I bet it's really interesting to ya'll. LoL Well, Nicolina I am sorry that we couldn't come see you and I would have rather gone to see you, maybe sometime soon. I miss you. Well, as interesting as his life is, my hands are tired from typing so I think I will end here... Did you like the part where they didn't want to come see me? I did, thought it was quite amusing. O yeah I forgot to metion that just know I got to talk to Mike's mom, she seems very nice.

doc00450,6,"I think educated people sometimes tend to think they are superior, at least in some ways, to those who aren't. We have this notion that we are more civilised and/or cultured compared to them, and we live much more . I have to admit that even I have been guilty in the past of that, like when I see people living in villages or tribes, I would have a opinion that they are very backward compared to us, and of lower intelligence, Just because they can't communicate in English or don't have knowledge of things that we know. So why am I bringing it up? Cos I found piss in one of the toilet seats in the company lavatory just now. I find it amazing how people who are supposedly 'educated' or 'civilised' can't even learn how to piss properly. And even if they don't, is it too much work for them to use the damm toilet paper and clean it up. I doubt they would do the same thing at home so why the difference when it comes to a public toilets? People are so impossible to figure out sometimes."

doc00452,4,"I didn't have that long left in KL and so I thought I'd do something substancial with my time......so, I went bowling! It's the first time I've played for 8 months so I expected a score Steve Potter would be proud of - you know......above 100. However, I was pleased to get 5 strikes and a spare and a respectable score of 165. No signs of strain on my robotic leg either! To celebrate, I bought a few clothing items in the Body Glove shop where it was next to nuppence (but not quite - sorry Rach and Johnny - my pikido skills are wilting in this heat!). I also found out that Kuala Lumpur literally means ""Muddy rivers"" in Malay, from when it was a mining town - not exactly a glamourous name. Next I'll probably find out that Paris means ""shithole"", or Cardiff means ""English people Welcome"". I arrived in Melaka last night after the coach journey.....of doom! - The driver was on a mission to make everyone on the coach shit themselves and he was pretty successful, I'd say! - He drove like BA Baracus on speed. He was in two lanes for most of the journey and was shouting at people, laughing maniacally, and generally trying to push other people of the road. The journey was supposed to be 3 hours long and we arrived in 2h 15m! I ain't gettin' on no coach, fool! The guesthouse where we're staying is called the Kancil Guesthouse and is run by a fella called Dow. He really chilled out and the place is very nice - I have a sunspot/jungle scene right outside my room! For dinner we went to a chinese food market where we were the only western faces. All you had to do was ask for something and say where you were sitting and they would bring it over to you - it was great! I had the dumplings, unfried spring rolls (which were superb!), fish cakes wrapped in Banana leaves and some mushroom noodles. The whole thing was really nice but there was no point in asking what some of the things were as they didn't speak any english. After my meal, I was drinking my Guinness and I had my first creative moment in some time - I made a car out of the containers and rubbish left over from the meal and it was something Anthea Turner would be proud of if she was still on Blue Peter and not being such a filthy crack-whore. Well, today it is raining but I'm counting that as a blessing as the heat was beginning to melt my sideburns. I hope to visit many museums and take photos, and, if I can squeeze it in.......... a few games of bowling!"

doc00454,1,"Well, Kelly's birthday party was pretty cool. I got there a little late, but it was worth it. We went swimming for a little bit and hung out on the water trampoline and the lil floaty dock with a diving board. It was alot of fun. So, we swam until about 5...and then went and sat on the beach for a lil bit; ate, talked, some of us smoked. But yea, you get the picture. So then we decided that we wanted t go in and watch movie and such. They were arguing over watching School of Rock or 28 days later, until someone suggested Gothika. So we decided on that. So Maddie went and got her movie and we put it in. It's actually a really good movie, the underlying story is awesome, and the acting is good, but I think they should've chose someone else other than Halle Berry. But whatever. So, halfway through the movie, you could tell Maddie was getting freaked out, so she used the most common human manuever to avoid it: flippancy. She was always making jokes about the movie, and commenting on almost everything they said. When we told her to shut up, she said ""It's my movie, I can do what I want."" Then, at that moment, I realized that Maddie is a stuck up bitch and I feel really bad for her boyfriend, Jojo. Luckily for Maddie, I didn't say anything to her, and didn't realy want to; because I didin't want a fight to break out, especially at Kelly's birthday party, ya know? See, unlike little miss mine, I have courtesy and respect for people. I swear to god I'm never watching a movie with Maddie ever again. Kelly and Chris got kind of bad too....Chris would kind of egg Maddie on, and then Matt would start and then Maddie would finish, and almost everyone else would laugh. I almost left a few times, but decided not to. So, after the movie, Chris and I went down to the Lake to feed the fish and stuff. Then Matt came down and then the rest of them came too. So we sat there and fed the fish and it was about...9:00 or something when we did. We sat out there for like 10 or 15 minutes, and then we went back inside and played DDR and had cake. I ended up leaving at about 9:45, cuz my mom came early because my Uncle was at our house and wanted to spend some time with me before bed and stuff.And holy crap he is a freaking idiot! We lit off some fireworks, and there was one that was like a orcket or something and you wqere supposed to stick it in the ground. Well, what does he do? He holds it! He did it with a roman candle too. So I went home and hung out with my uncle, and we watched Futurama, Family Guy and Aqua Teen Hunger force. So then he decided that he was gonna crash in the basement, so I went back upstairs to my room and watched The Drew Carey show ^^. Then I ended up falling asleep, cuz I was really tired. My uncle woke me up at like 5:30 this morning to say good-bye because he had to drive back down to Aberdeen for a wedding that was at like 3, or something. And it's a five hour drive and he had to go buy a suit or something, so I don't blame him for leaving that early. I had the weirdest dream last night. It was just a bunch of crazy stuff. And Brandon was in it. It was crazy. So yea, Well, I'm thinkin I'm gonna go hang out with Brandon."

I'm inclined to believe them but I think I'll call UCA just in case.... Its not like the world will end if I don't see Pat play, since I saw him with Phil Pritchett and Cross Canadian Ragweed back in July and thats the first time in almost 2 years I've seen him live.... Last time was at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.... Oh, my, those were some good times... *evil laugh* :0) Also it dawns on me, since I do my best thinking at night, that I have no idea what's wrong with the world today... UT lost to OU, ok I can understand that, OU is better (shh, lets keep that on the downlow) but I gotta be loyal to my TU, ya know?

At least on the part of the Yankees... The Marlins just got lucky playing Chicago in the playoffs.... How the Hades did THEY get into the playoffs? Did someone die, or get bribed?!?!?! What the heck happened to my Astros? Too much drama with the changing of the home fields and then the changing of said home field's name like 4 times in the preseason? Ok, ok so I forgive them, since they were closer than they ever have been.... Which leads me into Ahh-nold.... Not really but we'll pretend it did... Who voted and how the hell did he get elected as governor? Can anyone actually understand anything that man says? Can he even run even though he was born in Austria or wherever???

doc00459,1,"Just ten blocks Figure it out from what I am talking about. Anyway, yesterday was a significant drug seizure in the Bronx. 850 pounds of pure cocaine, $500, 000, two guns, 5 people arrested. Somewhere out there, somebody is pissed. What would they be pissed about??? The drugs, money, guns? 850 pounds of coke is not a pretty penny that you want to lose to anybody. The seizure was said to have an estimated street value of $ 11 million. Of course, cops don't know shit. Let's try more in neighborhood of $27 mil. If it was for the cooking of crack, triple that. Once the coke gets to NYC, it is pure. They have to cut it down ( step on it ) and mix it with baking soda to give it quantity but you are taking away from the quality. Take a walk to the local grocery store and tell me why they have such a HUGE stock of baking soda, makes ya wonder. Baking soda was never that great a seller until crack came to play. Like I was saying, 5 guys were arrested. Two drivers that came up from Mexico. Three people here. They are basically fucked. The drivers might get away if they agreed to a "" Non-disclosure "" contract. In other words, ""I went to pick up this truck and I drove it to NYC and dropped it off. I had no clue what I was dropping off"". That is the case about 90% of the time. Drivers never have a clue what they are driving, delivering, picking up etc. The three guys in the warehouse have issues thought. Don't even think they are getting bail. 1 kilo can get you 25 years if you are found guilty of trying to distribute it. You can't say it was for personal consumption, there is no way in hell you can take 1 kilo just for your little nostrils. So, wish them luck, for they are fucked (That is the poet in me).

doc00461,5,"so, yea... last night was the prom. It really made me think. I guess that's how you could put it. Not just last night, but the entire prom in general, everything like planning it to making arrangements and everything else... I read Brian's Journal and I guess in a way I can totally relate to him, except, I don't have friends. I have Matt. And I have athletic training. I only seem to be happy, temporarily, when Im either with matt or training. It's really sad. I dunno. I dunno what I did that made me loose the people I cared about so much. I guess I just wasn't good enough. That wouldn't suprise me because it always seems to be the case. I try, I really do. But I get nothing in return. Ever. Maybe that's why all I have is Matt and training. I'm good enough there. Matt loves me, I know he does. I get frustrated sometimes cause it's not always as clear as I need it to be but that's just because Im so damn insecure. We've been dating for over a year and a half- I should be secure enough, but I'm not. I just don't want to loose him. Im afraid one day Im not going to be good enough for him either. It just seems like its going to be a matter of time because that's how it has been with everyone else. I can't loose him. He means too much. I love that guy with all my heart. He's my best friend (more like my only friend but thats ok because he's more than I could ask for) Im good in the athletic training room too. People depend on me. I like that. I have fun. But it's strange- people depend on me so much in there, but in the hallways I don't even exist to them. I guess Im just not good enough to get a ""hi"" in the hallway. Im never good enough at home. I always do something wrong. From the minute I walk in- which is usually late because the later I come home and the less time I spend there, the less time I can get yelled at, be littled, ignored, and in trouble. I try to fill my time with the 2 things that make me happy, but there's always this gap. This never ending ache. There's always a peice of me missing. Friends. Like girlfriends. I don't have any. I don't get it. I used to, but again, Im not good enough. I don't understand really. I walk down the hallways alone. Stand at my locker alone. Go to class, surrounded by people I may once have concidered friends, but feel completely alone. Nothing would matter if I wasn't there to them. It may matter to teachers, they're the only ones that seem to notice I exist anymore. Unless someone needs something from me. I hate this feeling, when I get this way. Usually I can hide it. Im a good actress. I've done it a lot... Prom last night was ok. I wouldn't have gone if it weren't for Matt. It was on a boat which was really pretty and it was a gorgeous night so we were outside the whole time which was great. If he weren't there I probably would have thrown myself overboard though. The whole thing about lack of friends and all really hit me last night with prom and all. Between planning the dance and me not having anyfriends to plan anything with, to during the dance.... to after when I had to friends to do anything afterwards with... I just felt like an ass. Even though it wasn't Matt's prom I feel like a made him have a bad time. I loved being outside and him holding me. It was the best feeling in the world. but, like I said, there was something missing. There wasn't that group. I liked it just the two of us sometimes but I dunno. It was different too because there were 2 dance floors. That was good and bad. I didn't have to see half the people, mostly those I didnt want to see. I was able to say hello and never see them again for the rest of the night. I also feel like I missed half of what was going on. It was just different. If someone were to ask me if I would do it again, I probably would as long as Matt came. This is better than senior trip which I said I would never do over again. I think there's something wrong with me. I can't be happy for an extended period of time. Im happy in the training room and with Matt. Thats it. The best night (senior prom) and best 4 days (senior trip) of my highschool career didn't even bring that much happyness. It's like I don't know how to have fun anymore, or what fun is. The senior prom pretty much means your senior year and highschool career is over. My senior year has pretty much sucked. As much as I gained, there's still a void. I feel like a peice of me is missing. I found one peice but lost an even bigger one. Im about to graduate highschool and have never been to a party, never drank, like never go out... I feel like I missed so much in highschool. I tryed to be a good kid and get the most out of it. I got involved, got good grades, played sports then athletic training, developed some great relationships with teachers but Im still not happy. Why? why can't I just be happy for what I do have. I dunno.... I can't... Im empty. I want to go out and have a good time, laugh till my sides hurt with people who love me, be myself and have them love me for it, to have girlfriends to have sleepovers with, freinds that call to see how your day was just because they care, that call you to see what your doing and want to know if you want to hang out, friends that smile when they see you because they're genuenly happy to see you-not becuase it's polite, friends that call at midnight because they need someone to talk to and that 10 minute venting session that we needed turns into a 2 hour long conversation that ends with both of us laughing and smiling forgetting what our problems were, friends that let me know, no matter what happens in the future we'll make it because we'll always have eachother. more so, I want to be happy- more than temporarily. Matt- if you read this, don't take it personally. you're more than I could ask for. you make me happy and I hope you know that, there's just a place for you in my heart and another place that's empty, a place you cant fill. I love you. I always will. Thank you for all you've done because its more than you realize and more than I could ask for. I just realized I don't know why I write in here because Im sure no one really even reads it. Oh well, it helps me get it off my chest at least......... later to anyone who cares"

Jesus always knows when one of His sheep are missing, and when one is, He finds it. I was lost...Jesus didn't lose me, it was me in my own sinfulness that lost me. But Jesus found me.

She's the one controlling what I do this summer, and I had asked last week if I could go to CSSSA in L.A. instead of backpacking in Washington. I asked on friday and she told me to call back today, so I called. And know what...? I'M GOING TO ART SCHOOL, I'M GOING TO ART SCHOOL. I really didn't think she'd let me go because there is a huge emphasis on going to an outdoor camp. But she said that the program would make an exception for moe. WOOHOO!!!! Now i've just got to fill out a dozen or so forms and send them down there by next friday. That's really all i've got to say right now. I ran into my old friend today on the bus, we haven't spoken in... 3 years? we used to be best friends but then had a huge fight in 6th grade. I don't even remember what it was about, sigh, i don't really care either. It was strange seeing her though."

For reasons I don't feel like discussing now (which actually make for one fucked up story), I've come into possession of two PowerMac G3 clones, a blue iMac, an Apple Mac G3 with a G4 processor, about 10 keyboards, and about 15 monitors (about 6 of which I threw out). These computers were top of the line back around 1996. They were beasts, maxing out at about 500Mhz, some having 24x CD-RAMs, and even one DVD-RAM (which was too old to play DVD movies, only used for massive storage).... For you window users who may not know; Macs can only be updated so much. After about 5 years Apple makes so many advances that they stop making new hardware and software for their older computers and they only focus on the newer groundbreaking models. These computers are almost 10 years old now. Anything that can be done to keep them in working shape has already been done. In an attempt to stretch a year or two more out of them I tried updating the software a little... Bad Idea... Apparently, mac clones don't like being updated and now both of the clones lost their systems-- they're completely useless now, and not worth the money to get someone who knows more about clones to install a system on them. I'd like to fiddle with the hardware but my dad is paranoid that I'll *break the computers that don't work and we didn't pay for or put any money into*...

doc00470,2,"Norway: making disciples of the Vikings The following is a report from Reinhold Scharnowski, European Coordinator of the Dawn Movement, from the third national Dawn Conference in Kristiansand, Norway in January 2002: ""Since 1993, a Norwegian team has been working to encourage a national evangelistic process through saturation church planting. During the 1996 conference, younger, radical leaders were reconciled with the more traditional part of Norway's Christians. Around 800 visitors, almost half of whom were under 30, joined the over 230 participants at this year's conference for the plenary sessions. In November 1996, Christian leaders set the target of planting 500 new churches by 2005; this year, church growth researcher Ommund Rolfsen reported that 146 of these have been planted so far, and that a national process of church planting has begun - though the target date may need to be put back. The number of new churches each year is growing constantly: between 1983 and 1993, 14 new churches were planted each year; the number is now 23 per year. According to Scharnowski, the most important developments visible at the conference were: The Norwegian State Church is planting new churches Around one quarter of the new churches are being planted by the Norwegian Lutheran State Church. This is surprising for many, because most European state churches still work with a strict parish system. The baton is being passed on The baton is being passed on to the new generation. Stefan Christiansen reported that the first ""Jesus Revolution Church"" had been planted in Oslo, with plans for new churches in Marseille, Barcelona, Milan and Munich as well as more 'New Generation Churches' throughout Norway. Leo Bigger, Swiss church planter and leader of the ICF Zurich, also spoke about planting churches for the new generation. In Norway, such new generation churches are no longer viewed as an unwelcome intruder, but as necessary new forms of church - new wineskins, but with respect for the old. ""During the conference, I regularly saw young leaders being hugged and blessed by their elders,"" says Scharnowski. Strategic unity There is a strategic unity and growing excitement about reaching the nation through planting all forms of church, from Lutheran through Pentecostal to completely new forms. Stefan Christiansen, who was viewed as a rebel only a few years ago, today preaches beside a Lutheran Bishop and the leader of the Pentecostals. Theology and structure gave rise to few discussions; the aim of achieving the unfulfilled missionary task brings great unity. Sten S�rensen, leader of the Norwegian Dawn team, believes that in 20 years, there will be 1,000 new churches in Norway"

doc00476,1,"Fighting my own demons....... Yea yea yea....... I know it sounds like an old metaphor but it is true in my case. Forgive me for being kinda sensitive, I just have some things in my mind that I need to either erase or accept. Right now, I am not leaning towards either direction. Last night was a great night, I didn't do anything at all. No poetry, No reading, no writing. I was just in my house enjoying the fact that nothing was on my agenda. This was a great thing. I was watching the news last night and a story broke that Amari's Baraka's ( Desposed Poet Laureate of NJ ) daughter was found murdered. I don't know why this bother me. A couple of weeks ago, Yousef Kommonyaka's ( Forgive spelling ) wife killed her child and committed suicide. It makes me wonder why are these bad things happening to these poets. I have been around death for a long time. My best friend was shot 6 times with a 45 back in 1991 and from there on end, it all steamed rolled. One after the other, friends that I grew up with were dying. Then, the unthinkable, I became numb to death. I became so unsensitive at hearing that someone was killed that it bothers people around me. Understand, From the top of my head......... Freddy ( killed ) Steve ( killed ) White Boy ( killed ) Kevin ( killed ) Harry ( suicide) Pupi ( killed ) George ( killed ) Louie ( killed ) Charlie ( killed ) Nelson ( killed ) Angel ( killed ) Orlando ( killed ) Tony ( suicide ) Mark ( suicide ) Boogie ( killed ) Shane( killed ) Tico ( killed ) Jerome ( suicide ) Jose ( killed ) Nelson ( killed ) This was off the top of my head and still, there are the people of aquaintance that are no longer with us. I don't know. Death has always been a weird thing for me. I have tried to accept it but now, I always feel that small bout of sadness within me. I have always felt like a loser, so my life could have ended and I wouldn't have cared. Then, I find poetry. I guess taht I have something worthy to look forward to. All these people that have and will die are somebody with a niche in life. They left behind friends, family, lovers, parents. Then the mourning starts and the battle cries of tears will steadily stream through reddened cheeks. I really don't want people to mourn when I die. My best friend Eric says that I know tooo many people to have a regular funeral. I guess he will figure that out when I die then. Since I am dead, not much for me to do but lay there. Ok... "" When I die, don't mourn me guys. Talk and laugh and remember everything about life. Remember that I tried my best to keep everything righteous. Remember how everytime I walk with you all down the street that I was overtly the protector in the crowd. I would fight to the end to protect my friends that I loved. Remember that I worked 100% at everything that came my way. From Poetry, to friendships, to love, I am giving it 100%. Remember my love of life, my love of honesty, loyalty. Remember what made me laugh. Remember my favorite poem. Remember me when I told you when I was alive, I will always be with you. If you read this, I have touched you. I don't have to be dead to say that you are a part of my life and that I cherish you. I tell you when I am happy and healthy and I am not afraid to say that you are family. So Eric......

It is likely that certain poetic genres are more appropriate to the genius of each stage than other genres. Cultures at the mythic stage seem to excel at epic (The Torah , Gilgamesh , Homer, Virgil, Dante, Milton). Cultures at the rational stage favor scientific and philosophical treatises (Locke, Hobbes, Hume, Darwin). Cultures at the relativistic stage favor lyric poetry (Wordsworth, et al ) and the novel. Cultures at the integral stage seem to prefer hyperlinked, interwoven, sphere-shaped screed-communities like the one you are reading."

doc00482,2,"Everybody's Working on the Weekend Well, not everybody. Just 5 people from work and two freelancers the company hired. We went up to the sleepy state of Delaware to film some instructional videos. Our first night there I witnessed some - in my opinion - disturbing behavior by my colleagues. It was our first night in town and the whole crew plus the client went out to dinner - where many a drink was had - then off to a bar where the client, 3 different managers, and the rest of the production crew drank themselves stupid. So stupid that the client and our business manager passed out on the bar. Two other company managers were trashed and the rest of the production crew was either drunk or well on their way to being so. I hope I'm the pot calling the kettle black - I drink both at dinner and at the bar however I was at no point drunk. All this made me really, really mad at how unprofessional this was. We'd just arrived into town, had yet to shoot a single frame of footage, and everyone is toasted at 11:00 pm with a 7:00 am ""call"" (production-speak for a predetermined time when we leave for our destination - i.e. the location). Typically this level of intoxication is reserved for the last night in town - not the first. Several times I mentioned to different managers that everyone is drunk and we should go before it gets too late. All of them simply brushed me off and told me not to worry about it. Well maybe someone should have listened to me since we were over two hours late arriving at our location the next day. Half of the crew was still drunk and everyone had a hang over. But maybe it didn't matter, since everyone that I worked with gave a 100% effort through out the day. What made me so mad is that the same managers mentioned above are so strict about certain company policies yet lack any sense of proper and professional judgment when they are out of town and on the clock. I've seen this type of behavior before at other shoots and in other locations. And I despise them for it. They've been made managers and yet they act like 18 year olds at a keg party when they should be setting the example. Anyone who is interested in responding please do because I'm curious about what others think of this situation. Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation? By similar, I mean that you were both frustrated and embarrassed by a manager's unprofessional behavior? Does professionalism really matter when the client has passed out on the bar? Is it okay to sweep any and all proprieties under the rung by simply declaring 'what happened out of town stays out of the office' (i.e. don't talk about it to anyone at the office)? Is my outrage unjustified since everyone was able to work through their hangovers and get the job done - therefore since there was no harm to the work was there no foul?"

doc00492,3,"I'm feeling a bit poorly and sorry for myself at the moment which is my excuse for not having posted anything for the past couple of days. There hasn't been much to report really. Well, there was the Guitar Teacher incident which was a bit strange... Like many 17 year olds, I used to dream of playing the guitar like some of my rock god (and goddess) heros, or should I say anti-heros, for this was the age of grunge, which meant unwashed hair and Doc Martens as symbols of authenticity. Anyway, I did some arm-twisting at home and successfully persuaded my parents to buy me a silver electric guitar to which I added several shiny hearts (I thought it looked cool). I also went along once a week to Ian's place, for instruction in the playing of said instrument. I think it is fair to say that I was probably something of a novelty: I suspect the vast majority of the teenagers who went in and out of his studio every week were boys not girls and that Ian wasn't displeased by having a young female to share his ideas on life, the universe and everything once a week. I think that despite my lack of confidence even I couldn't fail to notice that he was attracted to me. Anyway....(wavy lines go across the screen to indicate a leap-forward in time...) Cut to June 2004. I arrive in Yarmouth, having left La Vie Parisienne behind me for good. Having got completely wasted at my leaving party en France and performed a drunken rendition of various PJ Harvey and Nirvana songs, I decide that perhaps it is time for me to take action in order to learn to play the guitar properly. Really. I mean it this time. My chronic perfectionism shall no longer be allowed to hold sway (That's what writing this wretched blog is about for those of you who are interested). So, I decided that even though I'll only be staying in Yarmouth for a brief time it would be worth having a guitar lesson with Ian just to get the ball rolling again. After a week of being glued to the settee (Mum and Dad have Sky TV now) I open the Yellow Pages and give Ian a bell. Thursday 2pm. I turn up at Ian's house, the one on the corner opposite the Tudor Takeaway. I almost fail to recognise him as his long Spinal-Tapesque hairstyle has gone: in fact, he's completely bald apart from a long thin plait which starts at the base of his skull and hangs right down his back. Ian's having an argument with the mate he's employed to 'do a few odd-jobs' around the house and he decides to get me involved. 'Lisette, you know nothing about painting do you? Now, would you use gloss paint on concrete? You wouldn't would you?' After a couple of minutes of this we go inside. I'm never one to say no to a cup of tea so when Ian offers me a brew I'm incapable of declining. We get chatting about a number of different topics: mostly Ian's OU degree in Music and Philosophy but he interrogates me about my life to date, so I talk a bit about Cambridge (he makes fun of me - repeatedly - when I say I got a 2:2) and Paris and Toulouse and I feel as though my life sounds much more jet-set than it actually is. Ian tells me nothing much has changed: he'd like to move house, find somewhere in a nicer area perhaps with a garden for the kids but he's had to fiddle the books to look as poor as possible for the divorce settlement. Divorce? 'Yeah, Mandy and I split up two years ago. It's all amicable.' I remember Mandy: she was tall and blonde (Ian's girls take after her) and used to bring cups of tea into the music room during my lessons to make sure that we weren't getting up to any funny business. Ian doesn't seem to be eaten up by anguish, a worn-out husk of his former self, so I suppose I believe him. So, by now over an hour has gone past. 'Ian, don't you think we'd better get on with this lesson?' I suggest. 'Aww, do I have to? It's really hot outside and I'm feeling a bit tired... I don't think I can be arsed really. Why don't you book a lesson for tommorrow?' And so I agree, Ian nips out to the shop across the road and buys Rich Tea biscuits (the Happy Shopper kind), we chat for another hour, (Descartes, Seneca, Buddhism, Ian's childhood dream of becoming a marine biologist, the asylum seekers) I go home. End of story. On the way back I decide to walk past the house where I was born (just around the corner from Ian's) and along the seafront. I have an ice-cream, a small one, no chocolate flake (unusual for me) and walk to the end of the Jetty where a gang of irritating kids are taking it in turns to jump off the end and swim back to shore. It is sunny but quiet - there are hardly any holidaymakers about - and I still don't know what to make of the Ian incident. Or non-incident. Was he thinking about lunging for me across the black leather sofa under the framed poster of Spinal Tap he has hanging over the mantelpiece or did he just like chatting to someone about his opinions on the nature of existence or is the real answer somewhere in-between? 'Do you have that craving for partnership?' he asked me. Hardly a proposition. Hmm."

doc00507,3,"I took my students to the food musuem today. It's quite far away from my school and thus, we had to take a journey that had given me a big carsick before I knew anything about food of mankind. The visit was OK. The so-called musuem was a bit too small. There were a lot of pots and plates from different countries like Egypt, Middle East and China. Varieties of coffee and tea were introduced too! I must say I admire the creativity of the Mongolian as they invented a very funny yet practical pot to make skimmed milk tea!!! What a health- concerning race! After the visit came the real stuff---chocolate making! All my students longed for this 'special' event since they arrived. I sat with my boys. (A very good proof of opposite sex attraction works for all age!) One of my favourite boys made, a volcano I would say, rather than a piece of chocolate.

doc00513,3,"""She's always eating""... Well first day of work was good. My boss had the funny comment that made the title tonight. I was always eating between clients, but healthy stuff. Just because I am thin, doesn't mean I don't eat. I ate a couple of apples,and made them jealous with my leftovers of the wine chicken w/pasta and my homemade sauce. I still have a hard time remembering that I am seen as this dainty little lady by some folks who haven't know me long. Hey that's ok, let them think I am soft and sweet, it makes my harshness that much more noticed. As far at the money making side of things go, today was pretty decent. I had figured out how many students I need to enroll to get back on track and I am on goal day one. I don't know if it will last or not, but I am keeping my eyes on the prize. Ok silly confession time. I am going to put up a picture of Dr bowers in my office. I remember seeing one or two good ones on Calpernia's Vday site. I don't want you guys to get the wrong idea, I want her picture up to remind me how hard I have to work to become a patient of hers in the next year or two. Nobody will really know who she is, so I am not afraid that a client will get freaked out by the picture. I do like to keep myself motivated fully at all times if possible. I don't know why, it must be that male part still alive in me that has this addiction to drive and challenge. I loved the pressure of work today. I was alive again today, I was being challenged and had to think again, I was using my brain, and working for the first time in a long time. I know it doesn't sound like much to you all, but selling dog food was tough, there were many brands,and distributors, so I had be top notch or I lost out. My last job that lasted a month was not, it was rawhide, big whoop. I know it is a big deal to my old boss, but I just couldn't get it up for selling cow skin and dried bull penises. With the food it was helping pets live longer lives, with treats it was just giving your dog junk food. With this job I am back helping, by selling education, and possibilities to folks. I can feel good about my job,and feel purposeful if that is a real word. My new job is more stressful than I am used to, it is my first straight commission job. I was scared to death at first, but it is just like owning my own business, as long as they come through with the leads as promised. The upside is the harder I work the more money I can make, the downside is if I don't sell, I don't make money, welcome to the real world baby, right. Of course some funny shit happened to me as it always does lately. I do thank the universe daily for the comedy. So I am talking to one client who lives with his folks at age 37, of course to get him to talk I told him I was going to move back with my mom since I got divorced. Well I was right, he did open up, and I noticed his eyes light up when I mentioned I was divorced. He was 37, but looked like he was pushing mid 50's. He may of been interested but he had about much chance of getting me on a date as I do to give birth this lifetime. I am not one all about looks, like I can be picky with my life right? but he just didn't have that sparkle in his eye I love about the people I find attractive. He seemed dead, all the life seemed sucked out of him, and hope wasn't home. I am an soul snob, I look for a gleam in the eyes, and I am attracted to it. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the carnal, and I won't turn it away if the situation presents itself, but I love the inner light in folks. With Co I got both, Co was so beautiful a person when I met her inside, and she happened to be gorgeous on the outside too. I think I kind of dimmed the light on her by putting her through this. It is still there inside though, I see it, I feel it, I am unfortunately for me still very attracted to it like a moth. We had our time though, our dance has ended, and now we both have to move on in different directions. I doubt I will ever find the same exact light I found in her, but I have found others with the same kind of light inside, and I am glad they are in my life. The other funny moment came from the older lady who came in to take the class to help pay for her divorce,and to give her back a social life too. I mentioned my pending divorce and she starting going on how all men were pigs and she wanted to neuter her husband. I love it when gen women start bitching about men to me, its cute, weird but cute. Most women accept me as one of their own, and I am thankful every day it happens, I just hope it doesn't ever proceed to cycles, and I don't mean Harley's. I might be able to hold my own in the conversation, but I wouldn't feel right lieing about having it. Oh well speaking of lieing I need to call my cousin and cancel our meeting for him saving me tomorrow. I am just not in the mood to be saved right now, maybe I'll just use the excuse up in my new subheader. I really don't think I need to find Jesus either, not to be sacrilegious but I don't think he is lost, if so we better get him on a milk carton fast. I get a kick out of folks who are so proud that they used to be really bad people but now they are religious and think us normal folks are evil. I never really strayed all that much from what they call God and I consider the universe. I have always treated others fairly,and kindly, and have been thankful for what I have. I have had my little trips off the path, but never far,and never for long. My cousins were so far off that path it wasn't funny. I don't hate them for their religion I hate them for forcing it on folks. They aren't here to save the world, according to their teachings only one guy can do that, and they ain't him.

doc00514,1,"I just got back from my meeting with the other manager. Nice guy, but I don't know. These managers seem like they're really just agents who get to charge a larger commission. This place would take 15% of everything I do. That, combined with the 10% the agent takes, makes 25% of your income, before taxes , that goes away. Poof. I don't know how I feel about that. I don't know that having a manager is necessarily the thing for me yet. One thing I've heard is that they can be useful when an actor decides to be bicoastal... but I'm still working on being uni coastal. Who knows? I did leave a few headshots with him so that I could begin freelancing with him, but that will go away if I decide to sign with the agent from yesterday. We'll see what happens. Ooh, and this was fun: I forgot to mention that I hand delivered my headshots to all of the places that said they wanted them. I wouldn't do this for cold submissions, but these were direct requests. As I was dropping at one of the offices, I asked if the person out front could make sure that the requester received it. She said that the requester had just stepped out, and she would see that she got it. As I was waiting for the elevator, I heard footsteps. A woman came around the corner and said, ""Oh. I was at your showcase the other night."" I introduced myself and we shook hands. Long story short, she told me that she was the assistant to the head agent, and would be passing my info on to her. I called today to follow up, and I got another appointment! Yay. That's good news. The more agents I can meet with, the better. Bye."

This Winema was one of many firsts for me: It was the first one I've been to as a junior. it was the first time I've been there and not climbed on, or even seen for that matter, the 60 foot tall rock on the shoreline that everyone loves. It's the first time I've felt God lead me not to get into the worship, it's the first time I've hung out with... almost every group of people for an extended period of time. It's the first time I've felt unwanted by the class above me (if only for a short while) and it's also the first time I've ever missed someone so much who was there with us the entire time.

If you did not have a shovel in your hand digging it yourself you did not put in an inground pool. you paid someone to put in an ingound pool. when I say I am putting in an inground pool, I mean I am doing it all, from digging it myself to putting the water hose in it! (I do accept help from friends and family! so I will change it to ""we are putting in an inground pool"". we being me and my friends and family. I was going to subcontract out the digging of the hole, but lazy drunk white trash fers didnt show, didnt call etc, so I rented a backhoe and got after it! Now my grandfather convinced me that I could do it, and he was correct!....that brings up a point, if as we get older we realize our dads were not as stupid as we thought they were, does this mean that there dads are even more smarter? (more smarter? is that like more bigger? ahh you know what i mean so shut up!) well, 3 days into it, it started raining, finally tally, rain gage 8 inchs, pool 3 feet of muddy water! wooohoo dont need no water hose now do I?

I Call my boss ask if i can work the rest of week, since i cant do anything on the dig, no problem he say. i am pretty pissed but what can you do. Wed., goto work in rain, bad drive, pissed whole time, get to work, and find out friends dog had died, while his wife and kids were out of town! family pet, kids are 3 and 7 or some such, had the dog 11 years he is bumed. so my little rain not to bad. thurs. talked to friend about his dog tell him that sucks (Real guys dont show emotion duhhh) he says, ""I was felling sorry for myself, upset i had lost my dog, called my wife, she is crying, she is back in town she grew up in with visiting family and friends, and her good friend from high school, 2yr old had cancer and they had just 'unplugged' him, and he passed away, so my dog dying is not nearly as bad as that"" KINDA PUTS THINGS INTO PERCPECTIVE, WHO CARES ABOUT SOME DANG WATER IN A HOLE! Friday, get back to dig after work, Sat, get going on dig, but its slow, hard work, starting to get mad cause so muddy, so slow etc, wife talks to her sister, and gets the news that a fellow policman that works and is friends with her brother was killed by a drunk driver on a traffic stop in the town they work in. again, puts the pool into the place it needs to be in!

doc00530,1,"7:23 a.m. Monday. First day of Week Ten. Wow! Feeling pretty good this morning. I took half an actifed last night, so I slept like a frog. Woke up to pee maybe once. My plan is to do TotalGym this morning. Then I have my haircut at 10:00, so I need a quick workout. This afternoon perhaps I’ll be able to work in some gliding — I’ll see how my hip feels. I’m almost caught up with the archived Skinny Daily Post entries, I need to find something else with hundreds of archived entries I can read from the beginning! Here’s something I want to say about losing weight: I am glad I’m doing it, and I really want it. BUT I am angry with myself for not being everything I could be while still fat. I’m disappointed that I bought into this myth that you have to be thin for anything to matter. Therefore: I must work on being more fabulous NOW. And here’s the other thing I want to say: I am realizing that to me, the eating and possibly the weight are all about control, as far as any psychological factors may be involved. I had a little epiphany about that several months ago, and looking through my journal I see that the only really difficult spot, the only disordered eating event in ten weeks was when I didn’t want to go to the basketball game. Somehow food was a means of taking back control. More random thoughts: whenever I am “done” with losing weight, I will have to maintain it. I think I need to work exercise into my life in a more natural way. Hopefully, with a lighter body I’ll be ABLE to exercise more. But I’m going to have to do those things like always take the stairs, park far away, get a dog and walk it, etc. I’m not always going to have the luxury of all day to fit in whatever workouts I feel like. And here’s another thing. I bought an issue of Shape magazine, and threw it away within 2 hours. First of all, the “articles” are nothing but prompts to buy products. Secondly, there’s nothing useful in the entire publication. Next to no information. Thirdly, their photography is not consistent with the avowed mission of the magazine. I do NOT want to see underweight-by-30-pounds fashion models pretending to lift weights with little stick arms that don’t have enough muscle in them to lift a fork to their mouths. Another: maybe I should buy some nice workout clothes instead of the horrible oversized rags I wear now. 12:56 p.m. Well, it’s been quite a nice day so far. 1) the Measurement Shorts are half an inch closer to buttoning. Yep. 2) I got my hair cut and I look great. 3) My measurements are a little tiny bit smaller. I had a great time going to the hardware store and Ace. I looked so good with my hair freshly cut that it gave me all sorts of confidence, and I didn’t want to go home after! I wanted to stay out and show off. It was such a difference from my usual run-home-as-fast-as-possible self, that I began to get an inkling of how much self assurance I might have when I lose weight. It’s not that I have to look gorgeous, it was the feeling that I was NOT a freak. That no one was staring at me in disgust. 3:13 p.m. Did a little gardening. Nothing all that strenuous, but I’m going to give myself 100 calories. It’s hard work for me, maybe not for someone else. Here’s some fun news. My new jeans? The size 24s? Starting to fall off. Yep. Daisy is planning to call me at 4:00. I can’t wait. I so want to have a drink while talking to her. There’s nothing in the house except vermouth, so I will have a small glass of that. I can’t overdo it, there’s only a drop left in the bottle. Also going to do a little bit of gliding beforehand - I’m not going to hit my goal of 300 minutes a week at this rate! Not when Friday will be devoted to airports and airlines. 9:16 p.m. Just back from Target. What an ordeal. Mostly bought vacation clothes for Bucko, although I got a new blouse. I had to get a 24; it was a button-down shirt, and of course the 22 was too small in the bust. And the 24 is too large everywhere else. That will continue to be a problem for me no matter what size I am. But that’s okay, because: remember the new jeans mentioned above? I can now pull them down without unbuttoning them. Hee."

After the demise of the Little Tigers and the breakup of LABoyz, there was an ""empty nest"" period. But today, as boy groups are sweeping the US, Europe, and Japan, a local boy group fever (helped along by TV ""idol drama serials"") is reaching new peaks in Taiwan as well. The most popular group is F4, which grew directly out of the made-for-TV version of Hana Yori Dango, a popular Japanese comic book series for young girls. But they are not the only ones. B.A.D., formed last year, will release their second album in October, and Tension, led by David Tao, have also been doing quite well. Meanwhile, Lin Yo-wei and Lee Wei, two teenage actors who have made it big on their respective idol drama serials, will make their move into pop music territory as a two-boy team in September. There is strength in numbers, they say. Now that the boy group craze has gotten a foothold, we can expect one group after another to appear. Where is this wave coming from? Are boy groups really going to be the saviors of Taiwan's ailing recording industry? On a July weekend, the members of the boy group F4, featured in the ""idol drama serial"" known in English as Meteor Garden, are having an autograph session in Taipei's Hsinmenting area. Incredibly, thousands of people have shown up, creating a level of fervor that at least equals, if not surpasses, that generated by the Taiwan publicity tour of the Japanese boy group V6. As the crowd presses forward, the stage begins to wobble, and the sponsors have no choice but to abort the event to prevent disaster. Still, more than 20 people are reported to have passed out, and another four are in shock. Many entertainment reporters are moved to declare the return of the super boy group fever that seemed to have receded when the Little Tigers fell out of the public eye. Idol buffet Hai Chen is a junior high student, still attending ""remedial classes"" despite its being summer vacation. Taking advantage of a day off from school, she and her classmates have braved the sweltering heat to jostle for a glance at their idols. ""Even before they announced the cancellation they were already taking the stage apart, so we had an idea what was happening. But we still hung on until the last moment, when they actually announced the cancellation. What a mega-disappointment!"" Hai Chen, still in the bloom of youth, reels off the names of her favorite male stars: Nicholas Tse, Andy Liu, Nicky Wu, the Korean boy group H.O.T. It seems she goes for boyish good looks. (Andy Liu, who is the same age as Hai Chen's mom, is the exception, but Hai Chen says she can ""live with that"" because he is ""mega-handsome."") ""Everybody loves F4,"" she gushes. Though her classmates all have their own favorites among the F4 boys, because they are all in the same band, everybody shares the same obsession in common, says Hai Chen, so there are plenty of things to talk about together. Music critic Ma Hsin echoes Hai Chen's logic. An ensemble that brings together different images and characteristics is like a ""buffet lunch,"" with ""more for your money."" ""Everything you could wish for, wrapped up in one package"" is how she puts it. What makes F4 so hot? Even when they only existed as a group in a comic book, they were already immensely popular idols. The members had different personalities, such as the low-key and gentle guy, the playboy who is really lonely at heart, and the stubborn yet passionate one. When these four idealized personality types were given form as tangible people (or at least tangible actors), and they rescued the girl in the TV series from poverty, naturally the hearts of young girls in Taiwan never stood a chance. So who cares if these kids can't act? Market indicator A more diversified product that offers different types of handsome young guys definitely covers all the bases. That is why, avers Wang Tzu-shou, a music critic for the Min Sheng Daily, boy groups are always a good bet in a slow record market. Especially now, after a long empty-nest period for boy bands in Taiwan, many in the biz are looking to such groups to pull the industry out of the doldrums. Last year B.A.D. got noticed after performing well in band contests in the US. Mark Liu, former managing director at EMI, the company which has B.A.D. under contract, declared: ""I stake my whole reputation, earned through more than ten years in the industry, that if this record doesn't sell, there's no point in making any records at all."" And the band has indeed done quite well. Wang Tzu-shou notes that boy groups are suited to the ""roulette wheel"" mentality of an industry that is struggling to survive. They are composed almost exclusively of unknowns, so, except for the training fees associated with the earliest stage of popularity, they require little capital input. If a company puts its chips on the right number, the money will come rolling in. There is not even any need to figure out how to organize and run such groups: Taiwan record companies just have to follow in the footsteps of successful precedents from Japan, Europe, and the States. You can see how this works from a short history of boy bands in Taiwan. In the global groove The Little Tigers, who came up in the early 1980s, were a copy of Japan's Shonentai in virtually every respect, and even their most popular song was simply the Chinese-language rendering of a Shonentai hit. The formula was pretty simple: clean-cut looks, easy-listening melodies, and a few basic dance steps for the stage. Next up were the Crickets, composed of guys who danced behind Hong Kong superstar Anita Mui. Their trademarks were a tougher look and driving rhythms, fitting into the dance music fad in late 80s Taiwan. Then the LABoyz, overseas Chinese from the States who came back to Taiwan in the early 90s, followed the trail set by black ""break dance"" music in the US, and they even went for a ""black"" feel in their attire and physical appearance. F4 is a composite, with two Taiwan-born-and-bred members, one who lived in Singapore for quite some time, and one Chinese-American. They look sharp, and have a somewhat foreign feel. When you combine these features with their packaging in an ""idol drama serial,"" you've duplicated the product formula blown in on the wind of Japanese idol TV shows. ""Dream maker"" Liu Wei-tsu, agent for both LABoyz and B.A.D., says that F4 marks a significant innovation in terms of the channel used for making the boys into celebrities and also in the fact that the group requires a cooperative effort among different agents. But this approach won't necessarily apply to other boy groups. ""The success of F4 is a matter of being in the right place at the right time with the right people. Not everybody can be so lucky,"" says Liu. Stardom has to be in your stars, too. If the timing is good, if the record company chooses the right packaging and market niche, and if the managers judge correctly which way the wind is blowing, it's not that difficult to get famous. But pop culture never stands still, and even if you've got all the ""manufacturing"" techniques down pat, you still need an extremely sensitive nose to pick up the scent of the latest pop trend. As easy as ABC So have Taiwan's boy groups had anything special about them compared to those from the US, Europe, and Japan? Wang Tzu-shou doesn't mince words: ""Not a thing."" But one aspect that seems worth looking at a little more is the popularity of so-called ABCs: American-born Chinese. ""The children who emigrated or who were sent off to be 'little overseas students' in the 1980s have grown up and come back. They are more hip to Western pop culture and speak English well, which are enviable qualities. Now that a few have entered the field, they are sure to bring others in after them,"" says Wang. But this, he adds, is just a question of background; it doesn't mean a thing when it comes to style. While many kids are fascinated with boy groups, many adults are obsessed with Hello Kitty. Critic Ma Hsin says that they have something in common: The product itself produces a rush in the consumer, creating a sense of worship and the thrill of collecting. So both older folks who cuddle their stuffed dolls and young girls who gaze enraptured at posters of their idols get a sense of gratification. Hai Chen's mom worries that her daughter's attachment to idols will distort her development, but Hai Chen seems to know what she is doing. Pop stars are just another part of the youth vocabulary, and it's only normal that you need to know something about them to be able to talk with other kids and sing their songs at karaoke. Boyish good looks will always find admirers. So long as nobody gets the fiction confused with reality, being stuck on pop idols is just an ordinary phase young girls go through. We've all been there, haven't we?"

And it wasn't an elliptical! It was a treadmill !!! My husband arranged with his friend to get me a treadmill!!!! I don't even want to estimate the difference in spending! But he reassured me that he will pay it in a year's period, so it isn't too bad! My husband told me to consider this an early anniversary present (we have our wedding anniversary on June 28). I am so excited! Not only because of the treadmill. Mainly because of the faith he has on me to purchase me something like that. My husband is a very practical man. He would invest on something that is going to be used long enough to worth its money. I have to work...but I will be back later. Oh...and!!!

doc00543,3,"The Italian National Basketball team is currently defeating the USA National Basketball team by a score of 41-35 at halftime. This is not a fluke either. The whole reason being that the Italian team has the willingness and ability to shoot from the perimeter. The USA, arguably the most atheltic team ever, is inexcsably walking the ball up the floor. If they do this during the Olympics they will not get higher than 4th place. You see this team was inexusably assembled no perimeter shooters. Of course, international rules permit basketball to be the way it is supposedly to be played with actual zone defenses allowed. So the Italian team has shown this throughout the first half. And the USA team was responded with clank, clank, clank. Another problem is with the rotation problems. There is no way anyone can argue starting Lamar Odom, Allen Iverson, and Stephon Marbury over Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, and Dewayne Wade. Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury are virtually useless with a zone defense on them and another person on the bench, Shawn Marion, is just useless everytime he steps on the floor. Brent Barry or Ray Allen should have been invited over Shawn Marion. The whole reason why the first and the second Dream Teams were so dominant is that they would push the ball up the floor at every opportunity. They knew that they could score on anyone in the open court. Of course that was when the NBA was watchable. Now the NBA is forced to play some game that lets players take four steps to become open, but yet cannot score with any regularity. The EuroLeagues on the other hand are what true basketball should be. Everyone on the floor can shoot. The all defend reasonably well. All the players on the team actually have skill instead of just ""upside"" and jumping ability. If the Detroit Pistons played the champion of the Euro League Finals, they would get their asses handed to them. Plain and simple. I am sorry if this does not interest anyone, and/or if this does not make sense, I just needed a place to vent. 5:00 left in 3rd : Italy up by eight Although USA has finally figured out in the last three possesions that by pressing the action and going on a fast break offense works against a less athletic team. Start of 4th : Itally still up by eight. USA had it down to four, but this Versilly (don't know how to spell his name) guy drained two straight threes. This still looks like an upset. 8:24 left in 4th : Italy now up 13. Being a cynic, I now see China, Lithuania, Germnay, Serbia and Montenegro (Yugoslavia), Italy, and Spain as better teams than the US. Hurray, for 7th place in the Olympics. 5:00 left in 4th : Italy is running away with it now, up by 21. Its Over : 95-78, nevermind about 7th place, I am beginning to wonder if USA can beat ANY country (we only beat Puerto Rico with this current team) in the Olympics."

Later I was told the one gal who raised her hand first told the others, ""...hey, this is a trick question."" The other two hundred assembled that day didn't raise their hand. That's significant. If the Xians assembled in the catacombs in first century were asked the same question what they would do? Would they look around for their ""Minister"" or would they all raise their hands without giving the question a second thought? I've decided that the primary problem among Xians today is not apathy, although there may be plenty of that, but institutional forms that have usurped the ""priesthood of all believers"" to the point that Xians don't even know the teaching, much less practice it!

While it is Mel Gibson's right to create a film with his own artistic vision, it then comes down to whether the film is being done with a heavy influence of historical accuracy OR simply being made from ones own interpretation of an event.

doc00557,1,"I haven’t Updated for a whole week… My grandfather Died yesterday at before 6 pm. It was weird cause when I saw him earlier I wondered how he could still be alive. His legs have shriveled away into just bones, his face is more of a skull with his jaw locked open, and his were eyes screaming. I thought he was trying to say something… His eyes were looking at me as if the words were being formed by his frozen mouth. I went to him, but I’m no psychic, I could not glean the meaning he wants me to read without words. He began to move violently, the nurse said that he just needed his head tilted up. But, a thought came that when he saw me that was what triggered his violent reaction. His eyes were darting back and forth between my dad and me. I could not tell what he wanted to say. But it seemed important, enough to say at his dying moments. Fortunately I don’t feel anything, other than that my luck has turned bad. I feel like something else would be coming. I’m afraid to leave the house and I’m trying to keep myself busy. I was not close to my grandfather. My most colorful memory of him was when we visited him after mass, my father, me, jobert, jasper and candy. He would walk like an old man would. He would get the food he prepared for us and would watch us eat. That was two years ago. That time, Leonardo’s Lechon was still draped with some prestige and people still came to buy my Lolo’s Lechon. It got me thinking about how so much history has just past and so much pain we still endured. We still pay for the 60 million dept my uncle… my godfather made when he died. He was a man of vice who was stealing from my grandmother and buying her gifts with her own money. My Grandfather knew about that, and we all didn’t want to tell our grandmother cause it would just break her heart. Leonardo’s was the product of my workaholic grandmother, and my classic Filipino Grandfather. The banks owned everything under their noses cause of my uncle… and that was painful. I remember when my uncle would always have a get rich quick scam… and my dad would tell him it was unethical. They would not talk to each other for long periods of time. I don’t want to use my grandfathers death as any excuse. I hear it to often among my classmates. Their excuse for absence is a death of an uncle, aunt or grandparent. It would matter if the person was really close I guess. But I see no devastation in their eyes when they say it, just the quiet expectation that the excuse would be noted and taken. Its disrespect for the dead more than the living using the dead as such an excuse. Thanx for the condolences for those whose heard the news. In other news… a busy day today. I will finish the work on the written adventure HOPEFULLY today with some character drawings at poor quality. I have to buy page maker and learn it on the spot. Hopefully its not too hard. With my grandfather’s wake… my schedule has become more hectic. I hope I can get through this week in one piece."

It is WAY more fun to eat the big one if you ask me. Everyone I would like yall to meet Josh my invisible friend. *claps echo throughout the room, cheers jar at people's ears*SO, He and I also got into an argument today. He asked me if they had Girls' bathrooms in gay bars, and I told him no because I honestly don't ever remember seeing the little sign thing even ON the stupid door. Not like it would REALLY matter though. The little sign for a girl's bathroom is that stick figure with a dress. Call it a queen and most gay guys would be happy. Something to do to impress me: Change your name to Mr. Crunch and join the Navy. Then they can call you Captain Crunch. It will tickle my fancy.

doc00569,4,"Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) participating in a ritual marking of trees I went to see The Village today and I have to say that I really enjoyed the film. Perhaps part of this is because I had heard so many bad things about it that my expectations were low anyway. The film revolves around an isolated village surrounded by a wood inhabited by some unseen menace. The town's elders explain that a truce exists between the village and ""those we do not speak of"" (as the villagers call them) which consists of the villagers never, ever entering the wood. The villagers are also never to display the color red as it attracts the beasts. Outside of that, those who live in the village live quite happily. Then, one day, a tragedy happens and Ivy, the blind daughter of the town's leader, must leave the village, travel through the wood and get help. The only thing is that, outside of the town elders who founded the village, nobody's ever been through the wood and evaded the monsters. Will Ivy be able to do it? You'll have to see the movie to find out. To tell you the truth, I wasn't all that excited to see it in the first place. While I loved The Sixth Sense , I hated Signs (I never got to see Unbreakable ). I thought Signs was full of depressing people and depressing scenes. I hated the characters so much that, by the end, I didn't care if they survived. And, it's really sad when you're rooting for aliens to kill little kids. SPOILER FOR SIGNS TO COME. SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW SIGNS ENDS... And, I became enraged that they could kill the aliens so easily. Hello! If you have the intelligence to travel space, you'd think it wouldn't be such a hot idea to invade a planet where the bulk of the surface is a substance that can kill you! God, I hated that ending. Phoenix's Lucius is not really the life of the party, but charming nonetheless Anyway, The Village could potentially be one gigantic downer as well. Joaquin Phoenix is not generally known for dynamic, happy-go-lucky style acting. But, while he's a big silent type in this film, he manages to make the character more endearing than his character in Signs (did I tell you I hated that movie?). This is one of the downfalls of director M. Night Shyamalan. His characters tend to have so many secrets that they all seem so uncomfortable with each other. And, they all tend... to... talk... with... long... dramatic... pauses... that... it... makes... you... want... to... fall... asleep... In The Sixth Sense , Toni Collette happens to bring balance to the depressing characters. Her more flamboyant personality is a welcome respite from the darkness Shyamalan takes us through. In The Village , it's newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Ivy. Given her handicap, she could potentially be the most depressing of all. But, she has a warmth that draws you in. You genuinely care about her. You know why Phoenix's Lucius is drawn to her. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a welcoming respite in a sea of otherwise depresing characters All of Shyamalan's films seem to be constructed of a bunch of clues followed by a surprise ending, which wouldn't be such a surprise if you managed to string all the clues together. The Village is no exception to this rule. To be honest, I wasn't surprised by the ending because I actually did figure it out. But, I was so proud of myself and I was just so happy that it wasn't as lame as Signs that it helped me enjoy the ending even more. While it might be obvious to people who are paying attention, it's still difficult to discuss this film without giving the ending away. The critical watcher should enjoy an interesting discussion of ethics and will even be able to draw some parallels to the current political landscape in a presidential election year. The Village is Shyamalan's fourth film and, while I did enjoy the film, it indicates to me that he is becoming more and more predictable. This is, perhaps, the reason why The Village was panned by the critics. In the future, Shyamalan might consider taking an entirely different narrative course that wasn't so steeped in foreshadowing that you could bathe in it. But, for now, The Village is fun summer fair. I give it THREE STARS, TWO THUMBS UP AND A FRESH TOMATO . And, as always, if you don't like what I have to say, go to urlLink http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/village/ ."

doc00572,3,"Yup, I went off to a Christian conference organised by the B & P ministry but didn't end up going to most of it's praise and worship sessions nor it's messages. However, I was on time for every meal session and truly maximised my gluttony. I shared the room with two other girlies from work, and together we absconded most of the events. It wasn't that I didn't want to attend the sessions arranged for us, however, I didn't feel too comfortable with the way things were conducted... the message and testimonies were mainly on the business successes of the B & P members - so money-oriented. I didn't like it one bit. We were the most obedient on the first day, the welcome session had us 3 drooling over this really good looking Kiwi speaker (he looks like a football star!) till he started sharing about his wife and kids - we got totally turned off - hehehe. However, he was nice enough to give a prayer of blessing to both Lai Lai and myself. Whoah... upclose and personal... so cute looking! But, hey... we're both there for the prayers not to look at him! haha! Anyway, we were good, we bowed our heads and prayed together said our little thank yous after the prayer and left without looking back - we were actually not interested at all?! I think that was God working through us, and totally not tempting us at all! lol Anyway, we stayed throughout the worship session, and then 50% of the message for the night... and after that... we became restless... 3 of us hatched a little plan by not re-entering the room in 3s again. So, I was sent to go in and pack up and then go back to the room, while my roomies left the hall first and were waiting for me outside... I picked up Doreen's new Bible (yup bright yellow Good news version and a gift from her beloved bossie!) and stuff... and I thought Lai Lai didn't take her stuff across the table. So, I steathily crossed over here and there trying to make a really quiet departure from the hall. I took this nice-looking Bible across me that has a cover zipper and lots of little notes and a pen - stuffed everything inside and zipped it up... and tucked it under my arm, thinking that it was Lai Lai's... though I did notice the lady who sat beside Lai Lai kept looking at what I was doing...with her eyes growing bigger by the minute... I thought she was just being nosy, so I ignored her. I was satisfied that I've done a good job by packing everything up, and took one last look and went 'oops... almost forgot Doreen's menthos sweets'. Finally, I slowly stood up, and even pushed the chair back without a sound, and no one turned around except the same irritating lady who's eyes are rounder than saucers by now. I looked at her blankly this time, wondering what does she want... and she pointed to my arm and mimed ""That's mine"" ... I was so embarassed... and all of a sudden, everyone at the table looked at me wondering what was going on!!! HAHAHA! I was in the spotlight... errr... I mimed a 'Sorry' followed with lots of smiles in my embarassment... and quickly returned the stuff to her (good thing she is very forgiving too, afterall it was a mistake and nobody steals Bibles!). So much for wanting a quiet exit, I made a loud one instead... as everyone on the round table was looking at me with curious eyes . Oh well, that's life... don't we all make little blunders in life? When I got out of the hall, I related the little incident to the girls, and they had a good laugh over my silliness. Poor me! Morning time was supposedly our 'quiet time' in where all the 3 of us were required to pray and share with another member of our focus group. That's us, we're the 'cherry blossom' girls... and it's obvious if 3 young women are missing in the group of 10. I think I was a tad bit too direct with the lady who woke us up for the quiet times.... the first line she had for us after we introduced our names were, ""I was told all of you are not Christians""... duh? That got me ticked off... here, we have a stranger, trying to get a glimpse into our lives and checking our 'Christian lineage' ... plus our knowledge of Christiandom. I was turned off by the rest of the line of questioning there, really! I don't even dare to ask how my other girlfriend, who is a non-Christian, felt... Hmmmpf! So, there I went, straight to the point of not wanting to be part of the 'quiet time' group, as I believe quiet times are to be spent by yourself or with someone you're comfortable with... I was curt in some ways, and that probably made the lady feel that all the 3 of us are heathens! lol!! Err... probably just me, aye? Nevertheless, she went on and on about the story of 'man & God'... and I quipped in from time to time to shorten what she wants to say. Later on, I excused 'us' from the 'quiet time' as we wanted to go for our morning swim at the pool. However, who am I to complain? I paid a subsidised rate for the weekend where the package includes food, transportation and lodging. Yums... the food was really good, and we were just a good 100 feets' walk from the beach side. All the 3 of us were totally spoilt over the weekend, and we even laid out on the beach and got ourselves a little tan, plus a jacuzzi and sauna session! Nice, nice, nice! I had a splitting headache after my beach-whale session with Doreen that morning... and missed out on the beach games ... but joined the girls for a beer (I didn't have one, they did!). Anyway... I wish I had a sip of that golden liquid, it looked so tempting ... but the thought of having a recurring headache made me stay away from all that gold that 'glitters'... hehe. *Yawn*... ok... I need a catnap now... completely tired out from the long ride back to Cheras, and then me driving home to PJ to only get stuck in the jam for another freaking hour... hmmm... so much for my weekend!"

doc00576,5,"I was so angry that I started walking as fast as I could without running. The Prince was calling after me, and I moved faster to get away from the sound of his voice. However, being angry was taking a toll on me, and I was wearing myself out by walking so quickly. Soon I found a pond near a tree, so I decided to sit down to catch my breath. That’s when I noticed that everything had grown smaller the as I walked away from it. I could now pick a flower and put it in my hair, instead of leaning on it. The furry gray cat I had run into earlier jumped into my lap, and I laughed stroking it gently. “Hello kitty kitty, how are you?” I asked it, fully expecting a response. This time, none came. “What’s the matter kitty? Don’t you like me?” I picked him up and turned him so his eyes looked into mine. The cat blinked slowly, and then yawned. I set him down, and he ran off. It looked as if I had finally found a normal creature in this nightmarish wonderland of sorts. Leaning over to get a drink out of the pond, I noticed my reflection had changed. My hair wasn’t just hanging down my back anymore. Somehow, it had managed to get itself into two braids. My bangs hung down in my eyes, and I quickly felt my head to see if what I was seeing was true. My hair had changed, but the girl in the pond didn’t. She didn’t seem to move when I did. “Hey, aren’t you supposed to be my reflection?” I spouted quickly. “Aren’t you supposed to be doing an English paper?” She responded. I sucked in air, and stared down in bewilderment. “Don’t do that,” she said, “You look horrible when you bug out your eyes like that, put them back into your head like a normal girl.” I blinked and stared at her, and then I saw the Prince next to me. “It tells you things you know,” he said. His reflection’s mouth didn’t move, but instead nodded when he was done talking. I looked up at him. He was back in his formals, and he handed me a yellow flower. I smiled bashfully and thanked him. “You’re running out of time girly,” said my reflection. “I am?” I said shocked. “Yes you are.” “Well how was I supposed to know? My watch isn’t working!” I shoved out my wrist and showed her the swirling hands. She leaned forward and stared for a second. “It seems to be working just fine,” she crossed her arms. I looked at my watch. It now showed the time to be 11:35. I had ten minutes to kiss the person I loved, or I would become like Bob somehow. Who did I love? Why had my watch started working just now? How was I going to get out of all this? Nothing made any sense to me. Not even when I thought about it all backwards. The Prince’s reflection leaned in and whispered to me, “He might love you; you’re the only one here that is just pretty as he is.” “Thank you,” my reflection turned and said to him. I looked up at the Prince, who was currently trying to climb up the tree to get a pear. I laughed at him. He had no idea how to get up it. He was completely spoiled by his royalty. “Can I help you?” I asked him. “No I’m fine just hang on to something,” he said. “What do you mean hang on?” He stood for a second with his hands on his hips, and then shook his head disbelievingly. Then the world flipped on me. I screamed and reached for the thing nearest to me to keep from falling up into the sky. I caught myself on the branch and looked up. The pond was there in perfect shape. Not a drop had fallen out, but my reflection had disappeared. The Prince kept his balance, and then walked on the branch over to the edge. He picked the pear he wanted and then jumped back down. The world flipped again, and I swung around so that my feet were facing the ground. “A little help?” I asked the Prince, who sat cross-legged biting into his juicy pear. “Sure,” he said, and ran over to where I was. He opened his arms, “Let go of the branch, I’ll catch you.” “You promise?” I asked too scared to even look down. “I swear I won’t let you hit the ground. I didn’t want to stay up there forever, but I wasn’t sure if I trusted him. So not sure if he would catch me, I closed my eyes and let go. Somehow, in my head it made sense that if I couldn’t see what happened, I wouldn’t get hurt. Nonsense of course, but something told me in a place where up could suddenly become down, that I was right."

doc00579,2,"Apparently, July is bear season up here in Northeastern Arizona. We had a reported bear attack up here last week (See news story here) http://www.wmicentral.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12313336&BRD=2264&PAG=461&dept_id=505965&rfi=6 During this attack the bear chased a gal across through a barbed wire fence and onto a roadway where she flagged down a pickup and jumped in the back, the bear still in pursuit...When she tried to get into the cab of the truck, the bear attacked her again. Yikes. Then last Saturday my husband's uncle saw a bear in the parking lot of the newspaper offices. At the time, it was still light out and our offices are right on the main road. So basically this bear wasn't scared of cars at all. Eventually that bear crossed the heavily trafficked main road, perhaps en route to a mauling? My husband says if I want to see bears we can just go into the woods just behind our house. ""There are tons of bears out there,"" he said. Yeah, that's OK. My father-in-law takes walks in those woods almost every night, but he takes a dog and a sidearm. The only time I have ever even come near a bear was 10 years ago in Kings Canyon when a baby bear was prowling our campsites...and that time I never actually SAW the bear...I think I'm cool with never seeing one here either."

The change from investigative reporting, to info-tainment, to outright ""conservative"" propaganda began in the mid '70's...Now our media is owned by how many companies? Who owns them? It is like what happened to small bookstores and it's dangerous. It is dangerous to allow newsprograms to re-hash Clintons sex life while Bush committs ATTROCITIES in our name!

Apparently, the NHL thinks he should get another chance since being on Stage 3 of the NHL's substance abuse policy. It is basically on probation status. The Blackhawks signed Theo in hopes to turn his act around after the NY Rangers (of all teams) dumped his sorry ass this past summer. I am not surprised at this decision that NHL will allow Fleury to play after he blatantly broke his probation status. After what happened to Peter Worrell the other day (see blog entry dated 12/3/02) that athletes get special treatment when it comes to breaking the law."

Murakami is a rookie homicide detective who loses his gun and must go on its trail trying to get it back. This is golden Kurosawa. A simple set up, but masterful execution. This a great, great film that puts modern cop movies to shame. For those new to Kurosawa this is well worth a rent. Kurosawa fanatics will need to pick this one up. Another superb effort from Criterion."
doc00586,3,"As I've written in my first blog entry, Ala Paredes is my current ""object of admiration"" and, in a way, my ""muse"". She is really something. And, why am I writing all this? Well, because I FINALLY MET HER in person last night! Man, was I ecstatic! I was excited and happy beyond words! After meeting her, I was like floating on air. So, that's how a fan feels when s/he sees his/her favorite star or celebrity.:-O The story of THE night: I and two of my friends went to the RCBC Plaza to watch Footloose (an Ateneo Blue Rep play). The play was great. Every single one of them (actors) did a swell job! Nobody was willing to be outstaged by another, not even the dancers. The dances were awesome! The music (songs) was great. I cried three times and laughed a gazillion times! It was a really good one. After the 10 minute (half-time?) break, Ala went onstage. It took so much effort to stop myself from shouting. I was so happy I wanted to cry. My friends and I couldn't believe how pretty she was. I mean, she looks good and all on TV and in pictures, but in person, man, she's waaay better looking. Her tall, slim figure, of course, stood out. Even if she wasn't dancing like crazy (like the others), and she just stood there (in her model-like stance), it was impossible not to notice her. Her number was really short, though. Anyway, after the show, we went to get our share of the free ice cream bars they gave out. As we ate our lemonade-flavored ice cream bars, we waited just outside the theater to get a glimpse of the actors we liked most, and of course, to see Ala up close since not one of us could shut up about how beautiful she looks in person! (Yeah, she really is that pretty!) My guy friend couldn't believe he didn't notice her before (in Myx). So, after a few minutes of waiting nervously (in my case), she finally came out. She didn't have any make-up on save for lipstick/lip gloss. And, my friend says she noticed how nice-looking Ala's feet were. Hehehe:) Her height made us look like hobbits and her beauty made us look like common ladies-in-waiting and she, the princess! When she passed by us, I called out, ""Hi Ala."" And with the brightest smile I ever saw, she said, ""Hi there,"" or something like that. I introduced myself and she told me I looked exactly like my friendster photo. Hehehe:) And, then, she had to go take pictures with her friends. After a few minutes, I couldn't resist the urge to ask her for a picture-taking. Gosh, it's not everyday I get to meet this wonderful, wonderful girl (Add the fact that her dad is one of my biggest Filipino idols since God knows when!). I was really feeling my cheeks turn red due to nervousness and sheer embarrassment at my actions. Oh, but to hell with that, I love the girl and I HAD to have a picture taken with her! She agreed and the next thing I knew I was up in cloud-nine. (I couldn't even remember what we said to each other, that is if I was able to even speak at all!) I was just happy beyond belief! Really, really... My friends were really happy for me, too, even if I forgot to introduce them to her. They knew how much I like Ala and all. They didn't tease me or anything. Maybe, partly because Ala was really friendly and acted as if we were really friends (and I'd like to think we are). But, later, when I proudly told one of our other friends my happy news, I had my share of being teased. She told me I acted too much like a fan. And, here's what I said, ""I AM a fan! And, Ala knows that!"" :) Last night was a great night for we saw a great play and we met Ala. The night will forever stay in my memory for it was a night that taught me a thing or two. It was the first time I ever acted too ""fan-y"" and that made me realize that it's actually okay to lower yourself and just look up to another person, that at times I could and should swallow my pride (I'm usually quite proud) and act in a way I don't usually do for what will make me happy. After that, I also came to understand how and why ""shriekin' fans"" act the way they do. I found out that it wasn't bad at all, that it even felt great within! And most especially, I realized that Ala is just like me and everyone I know. She's but an ordinary person, who can be friends with another ordinary person. And, after all these, I go on to proclaim myself as the no. 1 ALA-ist in the world! :)"

HE left yesterday afternoon for Vancouver and won't be back for another ten days. To me, that's an eternity. Days stretch out in seemingly endless torture... I know, I know, it's not healthy and it's not exactly the way I usually am. But I'd just like to mope around. At least now, he brought my mobile phone with him so I can contact him anytime I want. And he can take photos. I think he's still asleep. I haven't heard from him since nine in the morning and it's 3pm now. Wait, you say. You thought this was my blog, not his. Well, you're right. Thing is, he's an integral part of me and whether or not my COSMO friends out there think this is proper behavior for a fun, fearless female like me, I simply do not care anymore. Hand me that chocolate!!! Later though, I'm going to Cavite and stay over my office mate's house and play with her son. I've had baby lust for months now but then... So, I have to psyche myself up to have fun for the next few days. It will definitely include shopping for a brand new pair of jeans. I want to buy something nice that will last for years but then again, the price tag would just kill me. Bargains are my best friends, see. I have never, and could never, purchase something that has a four-digit price tag unless it's a phone, a pair of good shoes, or a gadget that I truly desire. Then again, I may have no other choice. I do hope that the Linea Italia store in Megamall still has the 70% sale. Otherwise, I'd probably resort to buying 400-peso jeans again and use it for three to four months. I will sign off now or else, take root in my chair in front of the PC. Let me take a walk, a cigarette, and I'd probably be back tonight or tomorrow, at the latest. I notice that on my last entry (Sept 8) HE has gone on an out of the country trip though I can hardly remember where. Oh well. Ciao."

doc00597,5,"seriously wierd and freaky! yesterday morning, i woke up, but then kinda fell into an unconsious dreamworld which felt and looked like reality! it was like a really really bad evil shower moment. it started at the beach pty..which is why it seemed so realistic! because in my dreamthing i was upset with drunken pete so went to sit on my own on the prominade and was lying down watchin the stars just by the peace statue. as it was dark i couldnt be seen and i was in my own world, so when a white ford transit van wanted to drive down there they didnt see me, and ran me over. i think luke shouted look out so i sat up and it hit me and then completly ran over me. the thing that makes it even more real is the fact that when i saw pete like that i fif want to just go and dit up there on my own, but ended up goin wonderin with the girls and luke, and when we came back we were all standing at the peace statue and a white transit van came along there and luke pushed us all out of the way so we didnt get run over! its just soo real! coz it could've easily happened..and every bit of detail was identical! luke then rang an ambulance and my parents and i was taken to hospital. there was nothin they could do for me..i was dying slowly-internal bleeding as id been crushed. as there was nothing they could do i was inthe hospital bed gradually deteriarating. i knew i was going to die, and i knew i would never be able to see my friend and all the people i love again- coz they didnt know anything about the acident, coz of course it wasnt exactly mum and dads imediate reaction after finding their daughter was dying! so i wrote goodbye letters, one to my girlies, including little bits for pete and different people to be read out to all, and one to my parents. instead of the distant dream thing, kinda heres one i did earlier and pull out a letter, i went through the wholem word by word making corrections and adding personal bit...it was exactly what i would write if i found i was dying right now! for mum and dad, to tell them how i felt i not only wront a letter to them, but i expressed my feelings in a poem to them...again i actually wrote the poem in my sleep and could remember it when i woke up...its abit sketchy, but i did write it in my sleep! My Dying Goodbye I'm sorry if I hurt you I'm sorry I make you cry my time has come for me to leave so this is my goodbye. I know I made you angry and I know I made you mad but now I'm gone I'd hate to leave You always looking sad. I never really got to say how much you mean to me you really were amazing parents the best they'll ever be. I love you both with all my heart I'm too young to have to go But with my depart they'll always be the love i didnt always show. I'm sorry that i have to go I'm sorry I'm leaving this way I'm sorry i won't appear at the door smiling and saying 'hay'. I'll miss how safe you made me feel and you always being there without you I feel lost and weak cause' I'm alone and feeling scared. I love you more than the world itself and I'll miss you more everyday I wish I could have more time to care I wish that I could stay. Cause now I'm starting to get scared what am I going to do? I'm going to a place far far away I dont want to be without you! But i will be brave, i will be strong cause' my future wasnt ment to be whenever you feel sad and alone you can always talk to me. Mum and dad i love you I'll watch over you every day I'll keep you safe and happy and be listening to what you say. I'm sorry i never listened before I'm sorry i dissobayed i never did anything when you said It always had to be my way. But this isnt the way i want I dont like saying goodbye this is the hardest one I've had to do Because today I'm going to die. So with this my feelings i hope you know you know I'd never lie I'll never forget you, I love you so much But this is my dying goodbye. see its rather sketchy, but the fact i wasnt consious at the time makes it abt more impressive...and the fact i ment and meanit all! i then died..which obviously was inevitable! the feeling of dying wasnt actually there tho- i didnt feel myself go, it kinda skipped to when i was dead and going to tell my loved ones (not me myself obviously!) so it was mum, she was in the car n picked up chloe from blatch- insisted she had to be here coz it was important- none off them even knew i was in an accedent. so they went to the sports cafe, it was buzzin and loud as usual! when mum walked up to our group they all kinda went sillent and still when they saw mums red, puffy tear stained eyes, but people who wernt with us didnt so were still rly loud, so kim randomly jummped up and screamed 'shut up everyone!' coz they couldnt rly hear mum tlk! very unkim-like...but it could happen! mum then told them briefly what happened, quickly gave them the letter and hurried off in tears. kim, mais and clo then read the letter as everyone listened shocked into silence. pete wasnt there tho. i think it was a late start for him or something, so when he walked into the s.cafe late it was full of sympethetic eyes stairing at him, expecting him to have already known. it was horrible. then i woke up in tears!my pillows were absolutly drenched, because as i was writting the letters and poem in my dream i was crying....but i was actually crying in reality as well! very very strange! it was soo soo unbelievabley real! i couldnt stop crying when i woke up!i was totally spun out! it was that real! urlLink Family is so important to me&nbsp; Vx"

The fights, the lies, the heartache.....left from the shambles that was the relationship. Then there were the ones that you never forget...never want to forget....because you wish they were still in your life. You stayed up till the sun rose the next day talking to them, sharing the many hours of laughter and tears, remembering that first time you made love to each other, and hearing the sweet sound of ""I love you"" come from their lips. You feel the world has ended when that day comes in losing them. In either case, you move on, farther in life and make new relationships, but you never leave the memories behind. However, what happens when you remain friends with your ex afterwards? Does it become harder to know that the other is moving on with you? You see them laugh with another and you wonder if that was the same laugh that they had with you. Does it drive you crazy with jealousy that you are not the focus of their life? And will this feeling end when you find someone else? Is it true that is better to have love and lost then to have never loved before? I guess the reason behind this entry is that I had an unusual dream about my last girlfriend last night. We dated for about five months and this was actually my longest relationship I have had. You know how it is....it starts out great when you meet, everybody thinks she is perfect for you....but after awhile things change, you know more about the other, and you start to grow apart. In the dream, I am coming out of a shopping center/store into the parking lot. I see three people walk toward me to store. As they get closer, I see it is my ex-girlfriend hanging on the arm of another man and with her best friend. She has changed her looks....less innocent but more mature. They laugh and smile like there is no care in world. As I walk past them, we both see each other gazing at the other. She gives me a stare like you give to someone who you recognize from your past but can't remember when and where you meet them. She doesn't say anything and I don't say a word either....we just past each other under the lights of the parking lot. It lasts a few seconds but it feels as though time stands still for this stare. She then turns around, laughing and carrying on with her new love and best friend and I go to my car, alone in the dark. I guess that's what I am afriad of with any relationship....to be forgotten, to be passed on. I do not want to be just a memory or just another face in the crowd that you pass by. But we all have to face that fear....we face the fact that we move on. WE JUST MOVE ON"

doc00625,3,"Dear God forgive me for the acts of triteness that I am about to commit to!!&nbsp;OK, that's done...&nbsp; So, the majority of the world thinks a teacher's schedule is pretty f-ing cool. I mean, come on, we get 2 weeks at Christmas, a week in the Spring, all federal holidays,&nbsp; these random blow off days (cleverly titled TEACHER INSERVICE - I still don't know what the hell that means.), and of course, the crown jewel.......10 weeks of summer vacation!!&nbsp; Last night, I was approached by a typical corporate suit who began our conversation (after he&nbsp;opened with the timeless&nbsp;""Whatareya drinkin' there, cutie?!!"") by asking me what I did for a&nbsp;living. I replied that I was a teacher, to which Mr. Corporate countered with..""God, you are so lucky!! I'd party it up all summer. It'd be beer, bars, babes, and baseball!"" At least I think that's what he said. Truthfully,&nbsp;I was walking away as he was finishing the sentence (I'm not the nicest to guys in bars...but that's the subject of another blog). The point is (and yes, I'm getting there) the general populus views a teacher's calendar as ideal. I'm here to tell you.....I'm not sold. I began the summer in good cheer..caught up with friends, did some shopping, hit a few happy hours, prepared for and attended many nuptials, Then, came July.....and I found myself (after a brief vacation) with a lot of time to kill. Most of you know that I'm AWFUL at being sedentary. I maintain a pretty vigorous life/schedule and I like it that way. As of late, I'm struggling to fill my time. Here's what I did today (well, most of it anyway)....I laid on the couch, read, and played intermittently with the new features of Yahoo messenger. That's it. Today being my rest day from the gym - I didn't even do that. And to be perfectly frank, I'm hard pressed to think of anything that I NEED to do.&nbsp; I've become sadly familiar with the Discovery Health Channel, online Scrabble, and my daily horoscope. I have cleaned, organized, and arranged everything in my house at least twice. I've filled days downloading music to arrange the perfect work out cd, and my big task for tomorrow is to go to the Hallmark store and buy 4 birthday cards. An outing that I'm pathetically excited about. Get a job you say?? I should have....Look at me, I've even succumbed to the world of blog (sigh)."

doc00628,4,"i have looked back over a lot of my posts in the past few days thanks to some much dreaded free time. and i rarely talk about all the things i really really love about this world. because there are a ton. and i just started thinking about them today as i was driving. the top of my list of things that makes me smile is when a dog has his head out the window of a car. for some reason this always makes a great big smile cross my face. and if any of you are homeward bound fans you will remember when chance has his head out the window and he says bat dog. maybe that started my love of dogs with their heads out of windows. The second thing that always makes me smile is eating m&m's. I dont think you can eat them in a bad mood. once you start popping those suckers into your mouths then its a change of attitude. another thing that i realy love is when you tell a friend about a band you like and they kind of dismiss it and then your listening to music and they are like who is this? and lo and behold its the band you told them to listen to. thats great because then you can both enjoy the music. i always smile when i do something that i picked up from her. and its odd to sort of transform with someone else but it happens so no worries about it. today my shoe lace was coming untied and i remembered a way she showed me to tie things that keeps them tighter and i did it and my shoe was great. i also really love being on the same page as someone else. soo much so that you know that the other person is going to say and then you beat them to it. thats wonderful becuase everyone just goes i knew you were going to say that. my jacket smells like bug spray and looks like tent canvas. i dont know where it came from i just know that it is here now and it kept the rain off of me today. and maybe im not thankful enough for things like that. thank you jackets thank you mom thank you pencils thank you steff thank you refrigerator thank you mikey thank you music thank you guitar thank you picks thank you paper thank you words thank you pants thank you socks thank you grass thank you door knobs thank you sunshine thank you rain thank you mirrors thank you television. thank you blair thank you chris thank you steve thank you jill thank you bill thank you Chris, the long one thank you summer nights thank you don thank you peter thank you rachel thank you krissy thank you chrissy thank you theresa thank you steve thank you b thank you dan thank you all Rest assured there are more people i could have thanked ohhh before i forget thank you randy for everything"

doc00630,2,"I was up rather late last night working on some stuff and the E channel had something about ""manscaping"". Now in case none of yall have heard, this is some dumb bitches cute idea of basically guys trimming or shaving their body hair. I totally blame this on ""Sex and the City"", I am so glad that show is gone. Anyway, I myself have trimmed south of the border, but never shaved it all off. Also I have shaved my chest and under my arms. I haven't shaved or trimmed in a while, partly due to laziness and part due to my schedule. I was just wondering what the ladies thought of hair vs no hair and what we guys think about the subject in general. The other subject is due to me being nosy at the gym last night. This chick was complaining about going down on her guy, that it was gross. However, before I could go on a rant, her girlfriend said that it was just part of sex and that if the chick's boyfriend gave her oral, then she should reciprocate. Hearing that I just kept my mouth shut, because she said what I was going to. I mean, I know it is not easy for women to master the art of fellatio; however, figuring out how to make a woman cum while going down on her is not easy either. Honestly, I would never sleep with a chick that wouldn't go downtown. I love going down on a woman. Not only is it a turn on, but the ability to have that kind of power over someone's body is amazing. My theory is that oral is a reciprocal thing. Neither partner should expect the other to do it, if they aren't willing to do it themselves. I have never found giving a chick oral gross or disgusting. It is something different that I like and happen to be good at. Just wanted to get people's opinions on this one as well. Just remember Hewett and his band are up at Gerstle's tonight starting at 10 pm. If you can make it up there, come hang out, have a drink, and give them some support. Lata playas"
doc00631,4,"I’m a little worn out, but I do have a bit of time to write some thoughts down on the gay bars. The short version is that I love gay bars. I think that they are the most important spaces that gay men socially share. Indeed, for a lot of gay men, they are the only common space to be shared. Of course, though, things are little bit more complicated than that. I love gay bars, but I don’t love them equally. Some are horrid. Some stink of pretense and self-destruction. The all-time best gay bar I’ve ever been to is urlLink The Cock in NYC. It appeals to different parts of me: the kid who just wants to dance sometimes, the punk who wants to stand against the wall and scowl at people, the horndog who wants to see people get dirty, the nice boy who wants to have a conversation, the drunkard who wants another goddamned gin. As a single 27-year-old guy going through life and trying to make sense of everything, I feel something like an obligation to go out to the bars and to go often. With friends or alone. Part of my attraction to bars has nothing to do with gay people or community or social shit – fact is, I like to drink. I really really like it. So let’s just start with that: I want to go to bars so that I can drink my gin. But there is the other part: the bars are the place where I see a bunch of gay faces. Where people live out a big part of their private lives. Where people come looking for really important things. And sometimes where they find them. Not to be too obvious, but I feel that gay bars serve a lot of the purposes that the church did in earlier society. The downside, of course, is that despite all of this, the bars are completely artificial environments. People are not themselves in the bars. And you always hear that sentence: ‘You’re never going to find your boyfriend at the bar.’ I don’t necessarily believe that. Mainly because I go to bars, and I think that my head’s on straight and I’ve been a really good boyfriend in the past, so if I’m there, why can’t another good person be there? Then there are the bartenders. The people we pay to flirt with us, take off their shirts sometimes, listen to our life stories, and of course, provide us with the gin. I love bartenders when they’re good. Continuing my comparison between gay bars and churches, I have to say that the bartenders are like priests. They counsel and serve continually. And have sex with other men. So of course, I’ve had crushes on many bartenders in the past. There was that really cute one who worked at JR’s in Houston in 2002, for instance. He gave me his number, and I was totally smitten with him, and I called him and found out he lived with his mother. There was that one who I met on his first night working at Oilcan Harry’s like in 2000 or something. He was always incredibly sweet to me, and he helped me quit smoking and I sometimes would leave him a 100% tip, no matter how high my bill was. He still works there, but I think he’s been a little corrupted by the lifestyle, and we don’t bond the way we used to. Then there was Aesop at The Forum. I didn’t really have a crush on him, but there was a little something about him I liked for some reason. And he’s also truly nice – he burned a CD for me once with a bunch of cool club songs on it. Oooh, then there was that guy at 1920s earlier this year. I’m totally blanking out on his name, but oh shit, he totally melted me. He was this beautiful Turkish guy who was really humble and read good books and would talk to me for long periods at a time. I wanted him like baaad. And then there was Rand at Charlie’s, who was just yummy. And Bobby, who is still at Charlie’s and has the most beautiful ass I’ve ever seen. And Carl at Charlie’s. I don’t have a crush on him, but he definitely wins the award for lifetime achievement. He is the best, friendliest, most human bartender, full stop. So here are the gay bars in Austin and what I think about them: urlLink 1920s Club - One of my favorites. It’s a well-kept place on Congress that has really bad paintings of figures from the mob era. Farhad the owner is always standing behind the bar, usually doing absolutely nothing. The drinks aren’t cheap, though. It’s usually completely empty at happy hour, which I dig. The best thing about the bar is the fucking atmosphere. You can have a conversation and hear every word of it. Most of the negative aspects of gay bars – the bitchiness, the drugs, the blatant cruising – are thankfully absent at 1920s. It’s a good place for a date or to bond with someone you like. And I’ve had some pretty significant experiences there: this is the place where I basically got dumped, where I’ve admitted a crush to someone, where I’ve had a great fucking time every now and again. ‘Bout Time – Russell and I used to go there a lot before September 11, 2001. They had karaoke every week with Murrah. Murrah is…like Delta Burke and Bette Midler in one body. After the terrorist attacks, the tone of the place got really creepy and chest-thumpingly patriotic. The place always was like the Twilight Zone, and it just lost its kitschy charm for me. urlLink Boyz Cellar – I rarely ever go to BC. The bartenders all work without shirts on, and some of them are cute. However, it’s an 18-and-up club, and the crowd just feels really too young for me. It’s also very white. But at least people go there now – it sucked big balls when it was The Edge. urlLink Chain Drive – The local leather bar, except that very few people wear leather there anymore. Chain Drive has gotten really tame lately. It seems like in the past, you could catch people blowing each other out on the patio or whatever. Nowadays, it mainly older bearish men and good drink specials on Thursday – or is it Friday? urlLink Charlie’s – They’ve started charging me rent. Charlie’s is my bar, my turf, my provider of really kick ass drink specials. There are some negatives. If you go too early, it’s fucking nursing home. There’s a lot of cocaine being snorted in the bathrooms. But the positives are there, too. The back bar (where my stool is) tends to play a lot of 70s and 80s stuff that I love, from Madonna to the Pointer Sisters. Plus, like I just mentioned, I pretty much have my own stool there. (Am I beginning to sound like Blanche Devereaux at the Rusty Anchor??) The regulars are pretty cool people: me, Russell, David the Dealer, Adam, Dee, Ben and Daniel, all of Russell’s Mexicans, older David, (okay, I’ll say it) Casey, whoever else the regulars are. It’s very unpretentious most of the time, there’s a diverse group of people who go, and Carl is the best bartender. The whole staff was named best bar staff in the city this past year by the Chronicle. That’s might be a bit of a stretch, but hey, they won. Dick’s – Um, I don’t go there very often. It’s usually pretty empty when I go. But I do love their secluded back patio. I’d like to be naughty there someday. urlLink Oilcan Harry’s – Oh, Oilcan. The most visible and probably most popular gay bar in town. The first gay bar I ever visited in Austin. The place I have the most history with. You know, Oilcan Harry’s is not a bar that I like very much. It’s okay. I can have a good time there if I’m among friends. But I find it to be strangely soulless. I find the guys to be uninteresting. Every time I’m there, I feel like there was just a clearance sale at Abercrombie & Fitch. It all seems very attempted to me, like everyone’s trying to be a cookie-cutter fag. Plus, this is the gay bar that’s in every city in America. If you’ve been to a gay bar before, you’ve already been to Oilcan. There was a time when Oilcan was my main gay bar. And those were the days when I was profoundly unhappy in life. Not to overstate its importance, but I think that Oilcan was a part of that unhappiness. Like I was placing myself in this toxic environment that wasn’t giving me what I needed at all. I was at the Catholic Church instead of the Kabbalah Center. Every night was a cruel rejection, and I didn’t take it very well. So now I simply don’t go very often. I do have to say, of course, that there are exceptions. Not everyone there is an automaton. Manny goes there a lot, and so he proves me at least a little bit wrong. Plus, I did meet Russell there in like 1776. urlLink Rainbow Cattle Company – The gay cowboy bar. It’s a good place to take visitors from out of state, I guess. They have Latino night every Tuesday and Sunday. Two-dollar Dos Equis. Latino night used to be fun, but now it’s not. There are a lot of really sexy, sweaty, horny Latino boys dancing their butts off. But I don’t really fit in to that scene. It’s like I told someone recently, most of the people in gay bars are retarded, but these people are retarded in a different language! urlLink Sidekicks – This week, I’ve had a good time there. I usually don’t go, though. The nice things I’ll say about it are that it’s pretty damn big and their karaoke nights are pretty cool. It tends to be more lesbian than most other bars in town, which is good or bad depending on your outlook. They’ve hosted John Waters. It seems like the most wholesome bar to me. This post has gotten really long, so I’m going to end it now. I’ll be at Charlie’s tonight."

I just keep thinking about my first year teaching in the public school system and how unbearable it was but I was also having to tie shoes, wipe noses, and dealing with children who still had accidents. I don't think my 4th graders will be like that but you never know. I'm going into a school that only has one returning teacher in the 4th grade which makes me wonder, why? Many things keep going through my head about that and last night I had a nightmare about it. This room filled with children that just wouldn't listen or do anything they were told to. I woke up scared to death that my class would be like that. A bunch of wild children running all over me and then I thought I'm sure to have a few that won't be wild. I'm sure I'll still be crying the first day of school when I get home and probably the night before worrying about what type of children I will have in my classroom. Sorry Caroline I'm not trying to scare you. So with all that said I'm going to go enjoy my last day of laying in the pool for the summer. Just think though in 3 weeks I'll get a 4 day weekend.

Idlewild are one of my favourite bands & today I was them play for the 3rd time. It was amazing. Ast time they were over, they were promoting their album &amp; so only really played stuff from that. This time, with their new album not out until next year sometime (Roddy's reason for this being: ""I'm in no rush"" - brilliant), they played a selection of all their music to date. It was fantastic. I'm heading to dublin tomorrow - I originally wasn't going to go - even at dinnertime today I'd decided against going - but then Idlewild played & they are playing tomorrow so there's no way I'm not going. I'll be able to put up with anyone tomorrow if it's half as good a gig. It's quite a lineup - The Frames, Idlewild, Bell X1, Supergrass &amp; Halite (who supported Idlewild tonight & were a bit mediocre). Also got tickets to go and see Ben Folds in Dublin in November today - happy days. So today was a great day musically - I'm still on a bit of a high from it.

doc00642,3,"still thinking.... i talked about my urlLink anti-quality-image rant a couple posts ago to Greg & Lynn at Muggswigz the other night ... i was saying that middle - low brow evangelicals got money in the last decade and started to get embarrassed about how lo-fi their gospel was -- so they started developing sheen for their gospel. Started to think that gloss would be worth their while. and i was ranting that that seemed so false -- that that image-conciousness seems in direct opposition to Jesus' tendency to minister to Samaritans, Lepers, Cripples & Children. (Harry points out that in that culture -- children were a pure liability -- the likelihood is that they would die before adulthood but cost you lots in the meanwhile...hard for us to imagine given our child-centric culture.) So Greg, sent an incisive challenge across the table...yeah, so, but you can't say the opposite is true can you? that the gospel is served by purposely NOT trying to present it with subtlety and clarity, style and beauty? i'm always wondering whether or not this isn't one of those places where my values clash. Sometimes Liberals value asceticism because of its connection to social justice -- if i sacrifice and live on less then someone else can live on more. ascetics are not always the best of bed fellows with aesthetics. And here's where liberals might frown at artists -- Judas protests to Jesus when the performance artist breaks open some lavish perfume and engages in a sensual inappropriate hair washing. But its not the sensual norms that Judas protests – “we could feed a lot of poor with the money it cost for this!” And that scowl has been retained in waves upon particularly the faces of protestant churches. Lavish design and execution – art as worship has been rigorously lambasted as a violation of the Second Commandment – one of the great heresy of the Roman Catholic Church – ….so here’s how that long debate rubs my question – the defenders of “quality stamped all over it…” might say something like quality construction / aesthetics has eluded Christians for so long – why shouldn’t we adopt the idiom so that we become relevant? So my argument that there’s a value clash between social justice and presentational beauty puts me in the unfortunate position of Judas’scowl – MUST WE (!) be so lavish !?!? when the poor are going hungry? A few readers may not be following so let me be more explicit – “quality stamped all over it” was a mantra chanted by leadership at Cedarville College, my alma mater when I was a student there. Anything a Christian does – they suggested – should have quality stamped all over it. This mantra was then used to explain to critics in their constituency the sometimes lavish choices they made in building their buildings, contracting IBM to hardwire their campus at the front end of the tech curve. And while I was there I didn’t object to this ideology. It’s only in retrospect that it smacks of external obsession, judging our faith based on the perceptions others develop about us (“how’s your ‘testimony’?”). This burner is definitely still simmering…I’m having a hard time seeing through to the multiple issues at stake…"
doc00643,3,"Well it's official the Calgary flames lost the cup. As much as I was hoping they would somehow pull off a miracle and bring the cup back to Canada, you had to agree that Tampa was the better team. Faster and much more talented, they didn't rely on only one person (Iginla) to create all of their scoring chances. I really do love Hockey, I think of all the sports it incorporates everything, fighting, speed, excitement, and has the hardest trophy in professional sports to win. I'm a bit disappointed though that the sport is becoming so Americanized and the changes that are reflected to the game are purely so that it is more marketable in the good ole U.S. of A.

He also mentioned I needed to lose some weight, almost punched him in the kisser there, but then he said Paxil again, and I chuckled.

So I'm sobering up now (because I'm out of booze) and I'm watching Vanilla Sky (because I have a slight crush on Penelope Cruz). I've been thinking a lot about my mistakes, most of them made with a girl I went out with. It's strange, how the people we are now can be so different, although our names stay the same. How a few accidental moves could change everything. How a book called Awareness could rip me away from who I was. And although I'm a drunk, I'm young enough that it's not yet a problem.

I have known Josh now for about 3 years. Ryan I have known for just about a year. He and I are planning another bike campout here next month with plans on going to Devels Lake. Huge area to bike in Wisconsin. I will take photos this time. &nbsp; Other news, well I have made a plan that I am no longer going to pay rent and not own something. It's been a very small dream of mine to live on a sail boat. Every now and again the idea rears it's head up and reminds me of how nice it would be. Ryan's family has a 25' Morgan they want to sell for 3G and that is a great pice concidering it's worth 8G. At the moment it's in limbo. See Ryan does not know if his father sold it yet. I expressed intrest here not to long ago and I dont think Mr. Kyner thinks I was serious. So we are just going to have to wate and see whats going on. I said that I would even concider 1G more to out sell the guy. I called him today and hopefuly there will be something in my favor. There is a lot of things that I have to cincider about living on the boat and I will get more in to that the next time I blog. Things like there is no shower and no washer and dryer (that is the easy one) And what to do about winter and all that. Well, I am off till next blog."

The subject specialists who select the citations published in The Infography are urlLink professors, librarians, and other scholars who know the literature about their subjects of expertise, who know which information sources are seminal for research. The Infography (in-fóg-ra-phy) serves as the antidote to information overload and qualitatively suspect sources. It integrates citations to books, Internet sites, journal articles, and other sources that provide excellent information. Each subject entry in The Infography refers the learner to six highly recommended sources of information, and most subject specialists also include a longer list of other worthwhile sources for further research. Librarians depend upon citations to good information in order to serve their patrons and institutions, and The Infography brings quality, efficiency, comprehensive scope, and precise focus to their reference readiness. It invigorates their response to the most common question in libraries, ""Can you help me find good information about this topic?""

doc00657,2,"Young Muslim woman strives to reconcile her two worlds Sunday, July 18, 2004 By Michael J. Bowers &nbsp; After hearing for several weeks about the mean debate over whether three Muslim men should be allowed to build a mosque in Orland Park, I decided to attend the climactic village board meeting on June 21. &nbsp; I expected bitterness, and I got it. Forty-four people, most of them opposed to the mosque, addressed the board. Some of the things they said embarrassed me. &nbsp; On the other hand, a few mosque supporters said things I thought were unnecessarily hostile. &nbsp; In other words, neither side was completely right, and neither side was completely wrong. &nbsp; The debate is now moot, of course. The board voted unanimously to approve the mosque plan. Indisputably, it was the right thing to do. Construction will begin by September. &nbsp; In the meantime, one moment stands out: when 23-year-old Huda Krad, daughter of one of the mosque founders, addressed the hecklers. &nbsp; ""I am so scared right now,"" she said in a voice that trembled just slightly. To many, she said, the mere fact she wears a head covering makes her a ""degraded creature."" &nbsp; ""I was born and raised in this country,"" she said. Yet, ""I feel there is nothing I can say to people here to convince them I am a good person."" &nbsp; Huda's words reminded me of ""The Elephant Man,"" the 1980 movie about the Englishman John Merrick.&nbsp; Merrick was born in 1862. As a child, he developed an unsightly facial growth that earned him scorn and cruelty. &nbsp; The climax comes when a group of men chase the adult Merrick into a train station. He turns and confronts his tormentors: ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a man!"" &nbsp; Not to say Huda is unsightly. Far from it. However, I heard in her words in Orland Park in 2004 the same fear that John Merrick must have felt at the hands of unthinking people in London in the late 1880s. &nbsp; And I wondered what it must be like to grow up with one foot in secular America and the other in Islam. &nbsp; So one pleasantly cool night recently, Huda and her parents graciously welcomed me into their home on a quiet street in Palos Heights. &nbsp; The four of us talked about many compelling issues. But eventually the conversation turned to the central issue: the mosque. &nbsp; I congratulated the family on their success, and I acknowledged a few of the opponents were a bit ignorant. &nbsp; But still, I said, do not these people deserve a little bit of understanding? Are there not many Muslims in America who do resent their host country? &nbsp; I gave a couple of examples. It pained the Krads to hear them, and it pained me to speak them. But I think the issue is central to the conflict. It must be discussed. &nbsp; One example came from a report in the Arizona Republic from November 2001. A 22-year-old man named Moayaad Hamad, wearing a Polo shirt, Nikes, Levi's jeans and a cell phone, said: ""It's getting to the point where I hate being here. … I don't think many (Muslims) are willing to say this, because they are afraid to say it. … The Koran doesn't justify taking out the World Trade Center, but Islam means not just peace, but freedom. You have to defend yourself."" &nbsp; Here Huda's father, Mohamed, spoke up: ""I think Americans have all the right to be scared. I am scared myself. bin Laden would call me an infidel."" &nbsp; Huda added that Muslims are engaged in a fierce struggle over who owns Islam. The killers have seized the good name of her religion. &nbsp; ""They changed the name, and they manipulated the name, and they spit it back at the people,"" she said. &nbsp; ""And now we have to reclaim the name."" &nbsp; Here I realized radical Islam despises not only the West; it also despises any Muslim who dares cooperate with the West. In Baghdad, these three wonderful people would be marked for kidnapping just as soon as I. &nbsp; Huda believes peaceful Muslims eventually will win the struggle. She passionately believes the solution is simple: People like Moayaad Hamad, the resentful young Muslim man in Arizona, must replace their ignorance with education. &nbsp; I believe her. But in the meantime, I fear many more good people will suffer violent death. A few days after we met, I discussed my conclusion with Huda by e-mail. &nbsp; Huda was disappointed. ""After sitting with you and talking about this,"" she said, ""I'm saddened that I could not instill more hope for you. … Hope is what the people of Orland Park need now."" &nbsp; But, Huda, I said: My conclusion is pessimistic because I am pessimistic. For example, a London Guardian poll taken in March shows that 13 percent of British Muslims believe another attack like 9-11 would be justified. &nbsp; Huda, give me reason to hope, I said. Convince me. &nbsp; Huda responded by citing the Civil War. ""President Lincoln had many around him that spoke of all the death that was happening."" Blood flowed in rivers. ""How many people asked the question, 'How many more people have to die?' &nbsp; ""And when they asked that question, why didn't Lincoln share in their pessimism? I'll tell you why. Because he didn't look at the situation through a microscope. ... He looked at the situation with a greater vision."" &nbsp; Hope is not an option, Huda said. It is an obligation. It is essential for change. Without hope, failure is guaranteed. &nbsp; And so I promised Huda I would hope. &nbsp; I will hope even more when we finish off the resistance in Iraq. &nbsp; I'm not sure, but I think Huda would agree with me. &nbsp; ## &nbsp; &nbsp;"
doc00658,3,"I stayed up till 2 AM last night finishing this one. I think this was the first ""history"" I've ever read outside of reading for school-- I'm a novel junkie-- but it was no issue for me; this peculiar little account reads like a novel. Winchester tells the story of a professor (the primary editor of the Oxford English Dictionary , James Murray), and of a madman (Dr. William Minor, an instutionalized schizophrenic [but originallly placed in Broadmoor for murder, not necessarily illness], who voluntarily procured thousands of the famous quotations found in the OED while living in his two book-lined asylum cells.) Meticulous by day and ""mad"" by night, it's fascinating for me to consider whether or not Minor's schizophrenia might've enabled him to contribute so widely to the dictionary. Mainly, however, this book is about how these two exraordinarily different men's lives intertwine to create one Oxford English Dictionary . Their story is remarkable. Here are two excellent links: urlLink NPR Interview with Winchester urlLink Official Simon Winchester page This specific page to which I'm linking deals with Madman ."

What better way to at least stay awake (not sure how SK feels about blogger) than to post an entry to my site....so here we go Last night was awesome because I had my first taste of crawfish and beer with my dear friend Candace. We went to Sammy's on Highland Road, and I highly recommend everyone in BR to try that place out. It was the first time I had been there, but the crawfish were excellent and the beer was ice cold...nothing like that southern culture! After we ate, we went to the casino...I got home to my roommate telling me that I spend far too much time at the casino and that I should not go as often. Then everyone agreed with her, so I guess we will have to see if I can cut back or something. Today I will be going home when I get off of work....I actually am looking forward to spending the entire night with my family at my house. Bobby will be coming over to watch a movie with me later tonight, so I will get to see him as well. But it has been a while since I got to hang out with my parents and just spend time at home. Tomorrow, I will be going to Harrah's to see if I can get me a spot on Wheel of Fortune! How cool is that? I really don't even care if I get on the show, I just wanna spin the wheel! Upcoming events in my life include LMT DCON next weekend, which should be interesting since we have very few, if any, announced candidates. Beyond that is my birthday, and the night before my birthday, I will be going to see a taping of the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. How awesome is that?? Bobby scored 6 free tickets, so Im excited about that, especially since LSU CKI had the chance to get tickets and they chose a day that I had night class. It still sucks for all the other LSU members who also had night class, but I guess when the board wants to go on a Tuesday, you go on a Tuesday. Speaking of LSU CKI, it's gaining a higher tone of being pathetic every week. Attendance at meetings has dopped to the old board, the new board, the committee chairs, and Eddie. Something needs to be done and fast, and I hope that the new board will be strong enough to overcome what has happened to what used to be a great club in its time in office. But that's enough of that, I could say more, but it wouldn't be nice and I am in a good mood. Got a phone call last night from a good friend I hadn't heard from in a while....he was drunk and hanging out around midnight with some of his friends from work. It was great talking to him, despite that I had been asleep and he was smashed. Hopefully, we will get the chance to hang out and catch up pretty soon. My phone also rang at 540 this morning, which I was less than happy about...a number that looks familiar, but I cannot pinpoint why.

doc00678,4,"A few of my traveling companions and I made our way to this little island south of Ocean City, MD — a state park named after the Indians who once lived there that, get this, were driven off the island by some settlers. Read all about the Assateague Indians urlLink here , or the island itself, urlLink here , or even about the wild horses that don't so much roam the island as wait by the road to be ""killed by kindness,"" as one flyer put it, urlLink here. As for the real deal, well, we left the fine state of PA for this island Thursday, June 03 and docked up in some chain lodge that night, then made our way to Assateague the next morning. A good arch of a bridge put us over the bay and a merry old site of canoes and a some sort of sea fowl's nest perched on a miniature lighthouse-looking thing coming out of the water. These wild horses, which weren't as much wild as they were homeless, I would say, were shitting all over the road and in the swamps, and not minding one bit. You could tell they were just hanging alongside the pavement, waiting for some poor sucker to come along and give them a snack, which would inevitably lead them to continue this method of panhandling until one gloomy night an unwarry traveler would smack a horse dead on in the middle of the road, which actually happens, and when such an occurance took place in 2000, they drew up a special flyer with the headline ""Killed By Kindness"" which was simulatenaously hilarious even surrounded by all the standard bummer feelings one might rouse up at the thought of a dead horse who probably had never even got to star in his own porn. Anyway, cloudy skies and warm weather, sitting with feet dangling out of some decent tents, beers and fruity drinks and the feeling that everything around you is foreign and perfectly naturally home all at the same time, sand in your shorts, in your slippers, in your drink, smoke on your lips and a foggy mind to keep everything wonderfully out of perspective—the work world a million miles away and when night came crashing over us in thundering stormy reality I was suddenly humbled and empowered by the fact that I was sleeping on an island far from home with nothing separating me and a night in the rain but a tent that we'd put up ourselves and were now as close to real as I'd been in a long very long long time. An early morning skip to the beach before we left where I sat by myself letting the water dance around my toes and somehow getting the feeling that as mighty as the ocean is it was showing me a bit of respect and allowing me to think that I had some control here. So much of our time was spent just living in this martian locale that we only headed into Ocean City once, for about an hour, to do the whole crab shack thing and Shawn kept reminding the rest of us that we were in effect eating something similar to a giant insect, while he no doubtedly dined on beef or steak or sirloin or some part of a cow. A real meat eater, you could say. Hilarious, what with my knowledge of him. But you'll never know, seperate are the reader and the original thought and all I can do is try to suck up some life now in the between of this adventure and my next, a cross country trip with my girlfriend, Jill, to the desert, California, Lake Tahoe and possibly a quick jaunt through Mexico..."

Today Active Living was really fun and we did fitness testing which I did awesome on and tomorrow we are doing the 30 minute run. I got really freaked out today though - I mean I didn't tell anyone but when we were doing a 5 lap warm-up around the gym I starting getting this stabbing pain right about where my heart is on the left side, then when I kept running the pain like stabbed through my stomach. I had the same pain when I went to go work out at the YMCA one morning and well I am kind of scared. I mean there's pain for a reason obviously and I have to run for half-an-hour tomorrow and I will do what I need to do to get a good mark - even if that means running though half-an-hour of stabbing pain but hopefully it won't happen again. I talked to that Aaron girl in Bio again this morning too - she is the only person I talk to in Bio and well I am glad that at least someone talks to me. I am scared for doing a lab though. I am not scared of any labs or anything, I am just afraid that I won't know anyone and no one is going to want to do that labs with me. Maybe I am just over reacting though and thinking too much. Maybe the gr. 11's could just go in their own lab group. Who knows really - I guess whatever happens, happens for a reason. I sort of feel out of place in English too. There are lots of people that I see as ""acquaintances"" but other than that I don't really have a lot of friends in my class. Making friends was never really my thing - that's Chelsey thing, then she just introduces me to people - but I am going to have to learn something right. But half of the people I would rather just not know, because I don't make friends with smokers, druggies, or people who can't focus, do work, or pay attention. My English teacher does seem really nice though but she comes across to me as a ""favour picker"" - those are the teachers that give students better marks because they are their favorite or they just suck up 1000 times, or they already know them. It is only the first week of semester 2 though and I mean I can't really make too many judgments or assumptions yet."

doc00687,5,"""In your lives you must think and act like Christ Jesus. Christ himself was like God in everything. But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit. But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing. He was born to be a man and became like a servant. And when he was living as a man, he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God, even when that caused his death-death on a cross. So God raised him to the highest place. God made his name greater than every other name so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus-everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father."" Philippians 2:5-11 (NCV)"

For a long time I was an advocate of urlLink T-mobile and I had been a member since the time that they were still called urlLink VoiceStream Wireless . The reason I was a fan was because they had very large rate plans for a relatively low price, and I liked their selection of phones. Motorola phones have been my favorite for a few years now. Two days ago, I decided to switch to urlLink Verizon Wireless because of their well known strong signal strength, and for their In-Network calling. They also have good signal at the beach, which T-mobile did not. I got a new LG Phone (see below) because it was pretty inexpensive, and didn't have a camera. I HATE camera phones. It makes the phone bulky and heavier, and takes crappy pictures. If you want a digital camera, buy one, and get a cheaper phone. And, people who take pictures with their phones are douchebags.

That's why I agree with that statement. And if I had to choose between the two, it would be W.I.E.A.Y.B. . But I also feel that it's good when a band that has such great attention from the media releases something that doesn't fit into the mold that MTV and popular radio use to filter everything through. Radiohead have the ability to stretch the boundaries a little, and they're utilizing it - maybe paving the way for more bands with styles and sounds that don't have such broad appeal to see some success, too. Might not see it immediately, but...who knows. The video's pretty cool, technically speaking. The idea doesn't interest me all that much, but I thought it was executed really well. It's really amazing to see things like that done. It makes me feel pretty bad about myself, though, since I'm soooo not even close to being able to do stuff like that. Thanks again, Radiohead."

doc00698,6,"Today felt like my first real personal day off, finally. No appointments, in processing or long briefings (although we had a short briefing at the end of the day, but it was not that big of a deal). Woke up early, about 0700 after a short sleep night, which included talking on the phone with my sweetie and pounding out stuff on the computer. I first went to take a shower. This is something I haven’t touched on yet, the latrines. The latrines in our area are basically modified mobile homes with toilets, sinks, and showers. The smell isn’t too pleasing (not that it smells like poop) it just has a strange odor. I think, though, you eventually get use to it because the first time I smelled it didn’t want to breathe through my nose, but now it’s not a problem. This is different from trailer to trailer. Some are cleaner, some are flooded from the showers, some don’t have any toilet paper and some are but outright nasty. The Forrest Gump adage comes to mind here, you know, the “Box of Chocolates” reference. One final thing to note here, the pipe that supply these trailers with water are above ground and because of the heat there is no such thing as cold water (at this time of the year). You have two choices of water temperatures, either hot or really hot water. There’s nothing like taking a hot shower in 120-degree weather and getting out to get all sweaty and sticky again. I guess that’s life in the big desert. After the shower I went over to the chow hall with the other amigos for breakfast. One thing I have to mention here, the Army has particular awesome tasting breakfast items. All the stuff I like to eat. Again, so much for losing weight. During breakfast we met up with yet another nice ITT guy who came from Afghanistan. We of course drilled him, like we do with everyone, asking about everything from what’s the company like to how are conditions in Iraq. He was very helpful and answered pretty much all of our questions. One thing that made me think, after I’m on this contract for several months if I ever run into a new person it will seem funny if they start interrogating me with all kinds of questions. Like I would be some kind of expert. I spent the rest of the morning uploading pics to our website. There’s an internet café here that allows you to connect your own system to their network for internet access. The bad thing is the bandwidth is slower than dial up, I think. It took 2 hours to upload about 50 pictures. At home, on the cable modem, that would take a fraction of the time. Well it’s not like I have a whole lot to do anyway. After that I went over to the ITT office and accessed their computer to check up on accounts and send out emails. I met even more ITT guys who were all friendly. I really like this company. It’s supportive and organized. Most of the people I talk to usually have positive things to say about ITT, much like my last company, OSEC. I’m lucky to keep finding these good companies to work for and not some trashy company who could care less about its people. I finished up the day with that short briefing from an Army Major about security and dinner at the chow hall. The dinner menu isn’t too great though, at least if you’re a vegetarian. I’ll probably be eating more dinner meals at the food court. Not sure but I think this day might repeat itself for the next year."
doc00699,6,"Go Rangers! Yesterday I watched an amazing playoff between Celtic and the Rangers. Both teams had finished the season with exactly the same points and so both teams had to beat their opponents with a greater goal difference in order to win. In fact, the whole points and goal difference thing was so complicated that even at the end of the Rangers match, we weren't quite sure who'd won the cup. Didn't quite go to the pub at 11 to watch the match at 3... that would have made my night a seriously short night. We ended up meeting up at about 1:30 which wasn't so bad. Mind you though, Julie and Tracy (the two that invited me along to watch the match) were drinking me under the table very easily. I couldn't keep up with the rounds and had to skip a couple. We didn't stay much longer after the end of the match at the sports bar.. it was starting to thin out a bit so we headed up to another bar/restaraunt to have dinner. That was the last place we stopped off as the night was seriously starting to get long... well we had started at 1:30. Only stayed till about 9:30 when the eyelids were starting to get a bit heavy I was having more and more trouble understanding the Glaswegians... either my hearing was getting slower or their talking was getting faster! I thought it best to stumble home and at least work off some drinks. Of course, after an afternoon of drinks, one gets the hankering for fatty, salty food. So I thought I'd try chips'n'cheese.

Tony: We hear you. We agree with you. It sucks that Bill Cunningham got appointed. Crying will get you nowhere. The reality is that loyalty plays a prominent role in politics today, and is usually rewarded with opportunity. Bill Cunningham must have one loyal friend to get a free ride on this trip. Paul Martin made it clear that loyalty would be rewarded (appointments) to certain candidates, and unfortunately it wasn't Tony's day. Tony Kuo signed up over a thousand new members to the Liberal Party, and what did he get? A democracy pie right in the face. I spoke to my good friend, and political strategist Max Fawcett about this very subject the other night. Max has always been the epitome of loyalty, having recently worked with him on Taleeb Noormohamed's Van-Centre campaign. Max has been a loyal member of Toronto MP Dennis Mills camp for many years, and is an up and coming backroom strategist in his own right. He's currently in Toronto working with Dennis to keep NDP leader Jack Layton out of parliament. ""Loyalty, as with most things, isn't an absolute. The current leaders of our Liberal Party are rewarding their friends, often to the detriment of others, but this is a form of loyalty in its own way. I suppose we'll just have to wait and see if these kinds of decisions influence the loyalty that Canadian voters have shown us over the past eleven years."" I couldn't have said it better myself. You can read Max's column at Dooney's Cafe each week at http://www.dooneyscafe.com/ His recent article ""Betting On Canada"" is sure to get political junkies talking. As of last night, the Burnaby-Douglas riding association demonstrated a kind of loyalty of their own, as they all unanimously agreed to step down in protest of the recent un-democratic process. None could be reached for comment, but suffice to say Bill Cunningham is now at risk for paying the ultimate price for loyalty. It looks like the Green Party may now officially have a chance at winning the seat in Burnaby-Douglas! Tony Kuo deserves a shot, as all candidates do, and the Prime Minister needs to rethink his stance on the ""democratic deficit"" if he really wants a mandate from Canadians. If I was Kuo's chief advisor, I'd be advising him very strongly to run as an independent, and quit wasting his time on CTV Newsdesk crying to Tony Parsons. He signed up over 1000 people! He's an electible candidate for god's sake, who has time for all these tears? Surely he has more than enough votes to take on shamed MP Svend Robinson and Martin appeaser Bill Cunningham? Hell, Jack Layton would probably let him hop on the NDP wagon if he worked it right. But sadly, I would bet this is near the end of Tony Kuo's incredible journey, and the reality is that there just doesn't appear to be a political animal inside of him that has any desire to really run, beyond sniffling on TV and berating the Prime Minister. It's a crying shame........... You can visit Tony Kuo's website at http://www.tonykuo.ca/English/defaultEng.html"

doc00716,6,"Next month, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will become the first transit agency in the nation to institute a permanent policy of randomly inspecting passenger bags and packages on subway and commuter trains, MBTA police officials disclosed yesterday. The stop-and-search procedure, largely prompted by the March 11 train bombings that killed 191 people in Spain, will involve explosive-sniffing dogs and all 247 uniformed MBTA police officers, and is set to be in place for July's Democratic National Convention, MBTA T Police Chief Joseph Cartercq told the Globe. ""I have no trepidation about being first,'' Carter said. ""I don't want to be the first to do an interview about having a serious incident that may have some terrorist indications to it. I want to be in a position to prevent and detect and apprehend someone prior to them causing damage. We want to do this to encourage people to feel safe on the MBTA, to utilize public transportation. As long as they are not too Draconian in their implmentation of urlLink this it seems like a fine idea to me. It always struck me how little public transportation security there is in the US compared to Europe. Nothing like the sight of a member of the Gendarmie holding a machine gun to keep you in line on the Metro in Paris."
doc00717,6,"Some days i wonder why i was born an Indian ...today was one such day. My parents and my two aunts are sitting in the hall watch this tamil variety show. So i sit down and watch with them out of courtesy lah. I''m watching the show and i'm trying to figure out whats so interesting about it. In the show its basically local Indian stars dancing and lip-synching to songs from the tamil movies , or else they themselves would be singing the songs, like karaoke. And I'm thinking to myself why would anyone wanna see something like that ? Really dun understand ...sigh"
doc00718,6,"Just to make you run from the room screaming; here's my useless prattle about redheaded Englishmen for the week. From an article someone uncovered on the web: FRIDAY: When I get out of this limo, I’m going to walk into a room and meet Tom Hanks. I must remember to tell him how much I like Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan, Apollo 13, his ‘serious’ work. But all I really want to talk about is Splash, Big, and Bachelor Party, the ones I grew up on. ‘Hey, Damian, thanks for coming. You must be tired after flying all the way from London.’ Tom is speaking to me. Before I can stop myself, I’ve launched into one of the unfunniest jokes I’ve ever made. I rub my arms, and blurt out: ‘Yeah, my arms are pretty stiff,’ (implying I’d actually flown). Geddit? Genius. Traffic comes to a screeching halt. Tumbleweed blows through the room. Silence. ‘Did this guy just say what I think he said?’ At least, this is the look on Tom’s face. His jaw slightly open, a look of utter disbelief in his eyes. The silence lasts a few seconds before Tom, realizing that he simply has to help me out of this horrible moment, yells out: ‘Aw, okay, funny guy. Very good. Sit down over here.’ He can’t possibly give me a job after that, I’m thinking, but undeterred, Tom cracks on. We act together. I play Winters. Tom does all the other characters. My accent is now rock solid. Nothing can shake it. Not even Tom’s beard, now so big for the film Castaway that I can’t be sure it’s even him talking. ‘Okay, you’re too good. Get outta here,’ he yells, oozing bonhomie. Tony To appears from behind another door. ‘Nice work, Damian, you have nothing to worry about.’ A little cryptic for my tastes, but assuming he means a job well done, I go out and get absolutely smashed until five in the morning. 8AM NEXT MORNING: ‘Damian, are you awake? Steven would like to see you at midday.” It’s Meg, the casting director. I cry into my pillow. Little simpering sobs at first, then naked hysterical screaming. The biggest meeting of my life and I’ve blown it. I’ve had three hours’ sleep and I’m still drunk. By midday I’ve had three cold showers, five coffees and stubbed my toe a lot. I walk into the office sweating heavily and shaking. We’re introduced. ‘I used to live in Hampstead,’ Steven tells me. ‘Maybe we know the same people?’ Not unless you’ve been around Kensal Green lately mate, I thought to myself. ‘Do you know Ralph Fiennes?’ he asks. ‘Yes, yes, I do,’ I nearly fall off my chair with excitement that I can actually continue this conversation with Steven Spielberg. ‘We did Hamlet together on Broadway. I played Laertes,’ I say. Steven remembers the show and even me in it. He saw it twice. He liked it. This is good. We chat some more. Steven’s off to watch his kid play soccer. I want to tell him it’s called football. Probably not the best time, though. Tom has to go and buy a Christmas tree with his daughter. They leave. Tony looks at me and says:‘So, ready for boot camp in March?” I leap up and kiss everyone in the room. I’ve got the part! I’m Dick Winters. I’m in Band of Brothers. Hey, he's an actor, therefore he's a Twinkie; he seems to write well for a Twinkie, though. I want him for my birthday, in case any one's trying to think of a gift for me."
doc00719,3,"Feast, Famine, and God's Sense of Humor... I don't know how to take the ups and downs lately, I am getting to live a bi-polar or manic depressive life, with out the chemical imbalance. Last night I was in tears from Aflac turning me down, today I had two interviews, set one for tomorrow and one for next week. I also am playing phone tag with another prospect. I don't know what exactly happened between last night and today, other than a few tearful prayers to God. I may be a recovering Catholic, and turned off from organized religion, but I still love and fear God greatly. I do pray to him/her all the time, not only in need but also in thanks. We are trying to bring up our children to have God in their lives too, my daughter is so cute saying grace at the dinner table every weekend. Anyway to move on, I am sure God did intervene, and not only through some opportunities my way, but some comic relief as well. First interview was with a recruiter for a local cell phone company selling service to businesses. My interviewer was a very nice older gentleman, very tall, which made me feel not so bad about being 5-8 wearing heels. So we did the normal stuff, background, his bs questions about my abilities my bs answers. Don't get me wrong I can sell, I have done so successfully my whole life, I sold that I was happy as a man, while all the while I was a female, at least psychologically. So in the interview, I used my charm and talking and get the poor man off into tangents, being my friendly self, and gathering info. Turns out he's from Maine originally just like my family, and we got to talking about his brother. He goes on about how his brother's wife left him for another woman, to which I replied"" well it is a great big world out there, and it takes something different to make us happy."" I am so glad I went pee before coming, I was dying holding in the laughter. It gets better though, we then turn talk to the group I would be working for ""Its a group of just young men, you would be the only woman working there, does that bother you?"" he asked. ""No I am quite used to working in groups of mostly men."" I quickly replied. He then went off tangent big time, and slightly out of bounds when he told me that he always liked employing ""beautiful women with brains"". He told me, ""you are attractive, don't ever let yourself be afraid to use it to your advantage."" Again I was dyeing inside, and he kept going,""I get allot of candidates in here, and none of them seem to have the total package like you do. You are attractive, your are personable, you present well, and you are smart. I think anyone would be foolish not to hire you, and you last boss was a fool to let you go."" Wow, lots of compliments, some bordering on flirting, I really appreciated it, but all the time I was laughing. I love that I have kept my ability to get people to feel comfy enough around me to open up, and say things they normally wouldn't. It is a gift I've had forever, and I guess still have. I think it's the smile, and how good I listen to them, that makes them share. Unfortunately sometimes people share too much. Overall whether I get the job or not, I really enjoyed the comic relief God threw my way. Interview two was with a major, big box company in the business of selling home improvement products, and sponsor a certain #20 car on the NASCAR circuit. This was the full disclosure interview. My interviewer is brother in law to one of my old bosses, an old boss that freaked out when I told him, and spread the word like wildfire. So its not like I had a choice in this one. I started the interview by handing him my resume, my good one with the cover graphic, he grabbed it joking,""Oh it's pink, I hate pink, don't bother to take your coat off."" Me and my wit replied, ""well if you are that upset about a color, I best not tell you too much about my past."" I then asked the big question"" so did you talk to John about me?"" He hadn't. I then said"" I don't know what he will have to say about me, but the last time he and I talked it was not a pleasant experience."" He looked puzzled. I then continued in telling him, after a brief pause how his brother and law freaked out when I told him of a change I was going through. He looked more puzzled. I continued"" I haven't always looked like this and John kinda freaked out about it."" He understood immediately, and told me he did not care, he could handle that. He told me how he had seen the dateline program a few weeks back, and had gotten a new understanding for the plight I was going through. I assured him, I kept my personal life just that at work, and would not be talking about my trans satus. It was a very good interview, he assured me ""my difference"" should not be a problem, and he would be calling me if my background came back good. I told him my old name, so he wouldn't be shocked. I hope he calls back, they do have good benefits, and I would still be doing sales, just in home sales. It was so nice to not have to hide what I was, and to not be afraid of latter rejection. I don't recommend this path to my brothers and sisters out there, it was a tough place to be. It felt like it did when I gave my presentation to my boss and my co-workers, like being totally naked and vulnerable, not fun at all. I lucked out with an understanding fellow, most who try get instant rejection. This was a good interview too. The only things that were bad about this morning was the fact I couldn't find my gaff and had to tape, OMG I cannot wait for Dr. Bowers or somebody else to take care of that. I also found out how much heels could hurt the day after blading for six miles, but you gotta wear them if you are gonna wear a short skirt. Before the interviews I got a call from an old friend in the bis. He wants me to come work for him in a bad way. I am really thinking about doing it. I need to prove to myself that I still can do it, and that my customers don't care what I look like. Yeah I'm sure I will run across 1 or 2 assholes, but that's life. I know my abilities, I've built little bits of nothing into a successful territory before, and GD it I can do it again. I am really excited about this, and can't wait to talk to him on Friday once he gets back from a trade show in New Orleans. I will try to keep y'all up to date, I hope you got a kick out of my experiences today as much as I did. This is not a fun journey, but I so enjoy when God throws a little comic relief my way. Love to all. urlLink postCount('107946569939812053'); | urlLink postCountTB('107946569939812053');"

doc00725,1,"Lauren was reading emails from last summer a moment ago... everyone's thoughts after the big Vermont trip, how we felt, how it changed us and the like. It got me thinking. Today was my first day at Lebanon with all the teachers, as a colleague. It was great. I was excited. I am excited. And yet I worry. I worry that I'm forsaking dreams for practicality, and that scares me. I worry that I'm going to become just another person in the system. I feel like I'm already becoming it, even as I fight tooth and nail with my soul. Lauren's somehow managed to avoid this, or at least it seems on the surface. She stays true to who she is, regardless of what happens. It's one of the reasons I'm madly in love with her. And things fall out for her somehow. They always do. And they always have for me, too... as long as I trust myself and hold fast to that which is RIGHT. Am I following my own well-trodden example now? I don't know. Is this... culturation ... happening to everyone, everywhere? Perhaps. But it scares the piss out of me. The idea of becoming a downtrodden drone is more than I can bear. And it scares me enough to do something rash. Heroes can be a funny thing, you know. The man I thought was mine - Jack London - turned out to be not such a good role model after all. Well, maybe he still is a hero, albeit one I now take with a grain of salt. You see, Jack lived hard. And he also died hard, and died far too young. The man took needless risks, put needless substances into his body, and in general asked for what he got. And yet his 'credo' (that hasn't even been proven to have been his words, after all the stock I've put into it!) still rings true for me: I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppermanent planet. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. I'm still so young. And I can see LIFE itself coming at me with all of its excitement. And I feel like I'm turning from the path of LIFE to the path of safety. I hope I'm wrong. At any rate, I'm only tied down for a year. A lot can happen in that time. In a year, my lease and contract will be up for renewal. And you never know what might happen then. I don't have to sign. Then again, maybe I'll still want to. Maybe right now, this is LIFE. Time will tell."

But what is surprising is what I read in urlLink The Hindu this morning... Besides the CBI investigation, the Union Human Resource Development Minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, has decided to constitute a separate inquiry into paper leakage. It was only last week that the Ministry had indicated a likelihood of asking IIMs to restructure the CAT process by doing away with group discussions and interviews to make it more transparent. I wonder why people are trying to infuse politics into education at the levels of IIMs and IITs which have earned worldwide acclaim for the quality of students it produces. Was he thinking that he could enable people to ""sell"" themselves to the IIMs by scrapping the GD/interview in the name of ""transparency""...?? Its better for the students and the country as long as politicians don't interfere with the affairs and procedures of such premier institutes of the country and leave it to the persons who really ""know"" what they are doing..."

I've been keeping busy the past two days or so, and now that no one's here, there's a prominent and reverberating echo that follows me everywhere. To sum things up...most of that time was occupied by THE VIDEO . Yesterday we went to Bi-Lo, where we filmed us defiling a can of peanut butter and putting it back on the shelf, and then looking at condoms and attempting to buy some and make it embarrasing as possible, all the while on film! We were throw out thereafter, tho. So, thus pissed, we went to some nearby shrubs and did some damage. Seth jumped into them once and smacked his skateboard into the curb and fell into them...I did a stagedive on them, face first, whereafter I rolled out the front and was witnessed by a couple 'o people, but no cops. So we didn't get arrested and that was great. We also filmed other stuff...it's pretty gross and I won't go into detail. But it's not us streaking (yet) so don't worry about it. At home, Seth and I designed the logos for this production, which is called SF, which stands for either ShitFiend or StupidFriends, depending on the audience. But moreover, it can stand for whatever you want it to. We just like ShitFiend. We also wrote a parody of Good Charlotte's The Anthem and a song making fun of Star Wars with an awesome porn music background. w00t w00t. And THEN...it was the next morning, and battling a lot of rain, we managed to get Alex and Brooks over here. There were many preliminary stunts with fire...LOTS of stuff is flammable. Seth's hand, basketballs, his skateboard, the ground...if it was burnable, we burned it :) It was amazingly fun to watch; moreover it was a middle finger to the age old clich� ""play with fire and you get burned"". I didn't get burned so HAH. Well, at least at this moment in the story. Then, we had Brooks ride down the driveway on a scooter and got Alex to pelt him with a basketball. He had some impressive wounding from hitting the agregate. Alex did it to and we filmed it from a downhill perspective, with me, my sister, Brooks, and Seth throwing balls at him. He was also injured by this encounter tho not as much because he stuck to the grass. Mostly it was that getting hit in the head really hard part that made him wail. AND THEN THE FIREWORKS. I had one more left in my house so we used that...I donned a new pair of jeans and took it in the right pocket, or so dictates tradition. We got it on film...it looks like I'm getting shot in the ass. I could watch it all day and never get tired of it. There's also the aftermath of me being on fire, where I take the hose and put myself out. We later went to Brooks's house and got his MASSIVE box of fireworks. I said (very foolishly) that I would take ten in the back pockets. They argued my will to six, deeming me much too insane and wanting to preserve the lower part of my body for motor purposes...wheelchairs, people, wheelchairs, but they didn't listen...SO. Three in each pocket. Surprisingly they all lit and exploded...that it truly an assorted rarity in bunching bottlerockets. Then, Alex threw one at me and it landed in my back pocket somehow...when it went off it streaked down to my ankle and blew. And by the way...not any of that caused the burn. The burn came from the last one. I told Brooks to give me one for the road and I filmed it myself. I don't know why but that one pwned me. I got a bit burnt so ouch. But it was all in the name of fun so ""smile all"" to quote Rosie. And remember, if I die, I die smiling, and that's what matters. We also have some really awesome footage of me and Alex performing Master of Puppets and Freedom . Seth is a pretty wykd fotographer. Anyway kids...that's about it. Just thought I would give an update and tell everyone how dumb I'm being so the rest of you can feel that much smarter. Peace."

As a Print Journalist, I have acted as an Editor, a Staff Writer, and a Magazine Columnist, and I authored and illustrated&nbsp;a Children's Book entitled ""The Frightening Lightning"" under the pen name of ""David Cooper,"" (a play on my real surname,&nbsp;Cubero,)&nbsp;published by Candlestick Press,&nbsp; copyright 1984, &nbsp;therefore I am more than capable of&nbsp;bringing to you written&nbsp;reports that may or may not directly effect you, but will nonetheless make for a VERY interesting read. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My experience&nbsp;isn't simply limited to reporting News via the various mediums listed above, I have also&nbsp; made &nbsp;The News Headlines&nbsp;and been a part of News Events and History&nbsp;as a&nbsp;local Politician, when I&nbsp;ran an&nbsp;unsuccessful campaign&nbsp;to unseat&nbsp;a long-time&nbsp;School Board Member in 1986. Although I took 39% of the overall&nbsp;votes in the general election and wound up in a run-off against the incumbent, I was ultimately&nbsp;defeated and vowed never to dabble in politics again.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have also been a U.S. Soldier, seeing battlefield action in both The Grenada Invasion and&nbsp;The&nbsp;U.S. Invasion of Panama. I am presently&nbsp;a Part-Time Police Officer and I once worked&nbsp;a Part-Time&nbsp;Los Angeles County Paramedic.&nbsp;Having these particular&nbsp;experiences, I&nbsp;have insiders insights into many areas of Public Interest, from U.S. Homeland Security to War to Crime&nbsp;and Punishment to Emergency Medical Care and Treatment to Politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the age of 10 months until my early 20's I was a working Film and Television Actor in Latin America and in Hollywood. In childhood I reached a certain level of stardom in Mexico and Puerto Rico. In Hollywood and New York I was at best a character actor.&nbsp;However, by the time I reached my early&nbsp;teens&nbsp;my acting opportunities began to fade into the sunset-just like the ending of a bad B-Western Movie. As time marched on, my acting roles&nbsp;became&nbsp;so occasional that I just gave it up altogether, what with&nbsp;ALL my other pokers in various fires. Nevertheless, I have this insider's experience as an actor&nbsp;and I&nbsp;even&nbsp;maintain Hollywood&nbsp;contacts that I can call upon to provide the latest information from&nbsp;The Hollywood Scene. Just a side note, in recent months I have landed a couple of film roles, small though they are, I may be making a bit of a come-back. One can always hope. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always asked how that&nbsp;I have managed to squeeze all of this experience, knowledge and activities into my 42 years of living on this&nbsp;Planet. It's quite simple&nbsp;really,&nbsp;I&nbsp;gave up sleeping long ago. Well, I sleep sometimes, but this propensity to ""over-achieve"" comes from the&nbsp;teachings of my beloved late&nbsp;Puerto Rican Jewish Parents who taught me that&nbsp;this world is a huge place&nbsp;and full of opportunities for adventure, while life is too&nbsp;short. I learned that if I wanted to delve into the exciting&nbsp;things that are out there for all of us to explore, I would have to work hard and sacrifice such luxuries as sleep and ""me-time.""&nbsp;Armed with this&nbsp;recipe for exhaustion,&nbsp;I have made it my goal to grow old without ever having thoughts of the things of life that I might&nbsp; wish that I had done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hobbies include Flying Airplanes as a Private Pilot, Scuba Diving, Amateur Astronomy, Internet Surfing, and Amateur ""Ham"" Radio Operations. These also give me the abilities to report to you the latest from the Worlds of Aviation, Aeronautics,&nbsp;Astronomy, Aquanautics, Internet Activities and The Various Aspects of amateur Radio. This promises to make this BLOG one with something of interest&nbsp;for&nbsp; all readers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

doc00739,1,"So my boyfriend, of over a year now, is somewhere on his way back from Kentucky right now. He took the weekend to get away, and anytime now he's going to be back. I'm scared. He needed this weekend so much, as did I, to just do something. I just wish we could have done something together! I'm one of those people that just can't get enough of other people. I try as hard as possible to not get clingy and over attached, but man is it hard. And when I love someone...I LOVE someone. I've never loved anyone in my life the way I love my boyfriend. Since day one I just knew that I wanted to spend my life with him, and with each day, I think I'm making it more difficult for that to be a reality. He needs so much space, and I honestly feel like I give it to him, but I guess I dont give him enough. I can tell when there are times that all he wants to do is get away, or have me go away...and that pushes me even harder to get that much closer, which in turns pisses him off etc etc. How do I go about loving a person so much without smothering the hell out of them, and without giving them so much space that we eventually just drift apart??? He said this weekend was exactly what he needed, and that he thought that it was really going to help us. I really hope so. Jimmy, I missed you so much this weekend, and I really hope that we can get back on the right track. I'm really going to try this time to give you what you need, whether its space or understanding, please dont give up on me!! I love you!"

doc00744,5,"Today on urlLink Attorneys Suck , a weblog by a frustrated attorney I've become mildly addicted to, the author sums up his accomplishments for the day. It's funny. And sad. But more funny than sad. Maybe. I had some similar days before law school, when I was working. At least at school I know I'm building towards a degree -- so days when nothing worthwhile gets accomplished are okay, because I know I'm still there for a reason. The frustrating thing about days in the real world when nothing gets accomplished are that it makes you start to wonder what you're doing, and why you're spending 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours a day in an office doing nothing, and what the meaning of life is. I'm on spring break this week, and have been having meals with a bunch of friends the last few days. Nobody I know seems genuinely at ease with his or her situation -- friends in the real world want to go back to school; friends in school want to go be in the real world. It's as if too much of either one is no good. This actually leads very nicely into some thoughts I've been meaning to try and articulate into a reasonably-coherent paragraph for the last few weeks. So I guess I'll give it a shot and see how it comes out. A little spring break introspection... ""Why I Like Law School."" ""Why I Like Law School"" -- reflections and incoherent ramblings after a semester and a half that hopefully have some relevance for anyone reading this who's not sure if law school's the right next step for him or her. First of all, law school is school. It's not nearly as different from undergrad as I thought it would be. The lifestyle is the same, pretty much. Classes, homework, extracurriculars. Lots of other students, lots of social stuff to do, flexible schedules, bad cafeteria food, exams. It's school. If you liked undergrad, you'll like law school. Workload hasn't been tremendously different. More reading, less writing. Manageable. If you survived undergrad, you can hack it at law school. Classes aren't as boring as I feared. Good professors are good, no matter what they're teaching. Less good professors are less good. But everyone's had less good professors before. It's not that big a deal. The hardest things about the real world were (1) having to plan my life -- knowing that if I didn't make a special effort to do things, I would get into a rut of work, eat, sleep, repeat and would be lonely, bored, and unfulfilled. Not a problem at school. Usually people around, and even if not, activities are all set up for student enjoyment. Searching unnecessary. Easy to join things and get involved. Lonely, bored, and unfulfilled hasn't been a problem yet. Thankfully. (2) pointlessness. At work, I'd ask myself why I was there, what the point was, what this was building towards. At school these questions have easy answers. I get a degree at the end. No matter how useless the day-to-day could possibly feel, the degree is still something tangible that's being worked towards. No one -- including my own brain -- can tell me I'm wasting my time. Of course I'm not -- I'm in law school. Regardless of whether I feel like I'm actually learning anything. The only downsides -- this is very expensive, and in reality it's only delaying the inevitable 3 more years. After law school, I have to go back to the real world. This is a nice shelter, but it's not forever. And, as the weblog linked above illustrates, being a lawyer doesn't magically solve the problems with the real world. Still need to find a fulfilling job -- and make a fulfilling life for myself. But even if it 3 years of shelter, what's wrong with that? Law school is fun -- I'm involved in lots of stuff, I've met a bunch of cool people, made some friends, learned some interesting stuff, and I come out with a really marketable and valuable piece of paper telling me I'm a lawyer. Besides the cost -- which I can earn back if I choose to go that route -- what's wrong with spending 3 years fulfilled and reasonably happy in school even if you know you're only delaying the inevitable? After all, isn't the entirety of life just delaying the inevitable until death? Why not make yourself as happy and fulfilled as possible? If I learned one thing in my two years inbetween undergrad and law school -- and my job really wasn't that bad, most days, but the days when it was pretty crappy were actually really good for coming up with platitudes about the meaning of life -- it was that it's just not worth doing something that doesn't make you feel fulfilled and reasonably content and at peace with yourself. Life is too short. Money isn't worth it -- beyond a certain level required just to subsist and live comfortably -- when (1) you have no time to spend it, and (2) you're sad. I feel a bit disturbed when my classmates say they'll go work for a big law firm for a few years and then they'll have a bunch of money. Fine, but after a few years of working 16 hours a day doing something not particularly enjoyable isn't there a risk they'll have no more friends and no more interests and hobbies. So what good is it? We have a limited number of days to play with. Is it worth spending them doing things that aren't making us reasonably happy? Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have answers. But I do know I feel better at law school than I did in the real world. So I'm glad I'm here."

doc00750,6,"Noisepop, here I come! Next week is noisepop and boy, am I jazzed! Here's the list of the shows I will be attending. 4 nights, 4 shows in a row. Holy Jesus, arrest me, I am criminally insane: Wed -- The Unicorns @ GAMH -- I'm excited about this show because they're a new band, but their album blows my mind. It's a delightful-edgy-beautiful-pretty-heartstring-tugging album that is sweet and quirky like The Flaming Lips, angular and bouncy like Hot Hot Heat, and with melodically prominent basslines like The Cure. The singing is sometimes soft and whispery like Elliott Smith, sometimes resigned and thoughtful like Grandaddy, sometimes frustrated and loud and yelpy like Steve Bays/ Robert Smith. The album is tinged with an overall child-like charm and earnestness like the Langley School Music Project but with an adult consciousness. (Example: my favorite lyric: ""Somewhere in the asshole of my eye/"") It's also a little Thriller by Michael Jackson in one song that has a comic-creepy Vincent Price-like voiceover. The album is wonderful and I'm hoping the show will be too. Thursday -- Detroit Cobaras @ BOTH -- I have never heard them. I'm going because the Von Bondies like them and so does Meg White. It's already sold out! I have a feeling this show is going to be good. Friday -- The Stills @ The Independent -- I saw them at Popscene last year, and they opened for Echo & The Bunnymen, so why is this show being promoted as their ""Bay Area debut""? I was divided between this show and seeing Neko Case at Bimbo's, but The Stills won because it's 8 bucks cheaper. And it's closer to my house. Saturday -- Communique @ BOTH. I'm dragging XX to this show with me. The headlining band is The Wrens, whom I've heard lotsa good things about. I'm going for the opening band, Communique, who are quite good. I like bands that dress in all-black and have solid dark dirgy music with melodic basslines(Interpol, BRMC, Communique). Though this formula seems idiot-proof, some fuck it up and make it a mockery, like one godawful band called MADELIA who are unintentional parodies that make shitty music. They're all posturing and artifice and are generally a horrible superficial band that do not rock. And they're serious about it! No tongues in cheeks. I've had the misfortune of having to see them twice. I left halfway the first time, and the following time I saw them take the stage, I ran for the door. The great thing about living in San Francisco is that all the bands I love come to me. Even if a band is doing a 7-city American tour, they always hit SF. And I don't have to drive from fucking, like, Monterey to see them. Everything's just a bus ride away, so in regards to bands? Life is good."
doc00751,2,"A quick technology story, just for my fellow nerds.... I have now officially given up on my wireless network, Micah and I could probably fix it, but we just haven't had time to mess around with it yet, so last tuesday I ran my really long cat 5 cable out Micah's window, around the apartment, and through my window. This worked, and it got me back online without crapping up the apartment with cords, but it only left about three feet of cable in my bedroom, so to connect the old laptop I needed to sit on the floor next to my bed. Clearly I needed an RJ45 gender bender to let me connect another, shorter piece of cat5. I go up the tollway through Richardson on my way home from work, so I stopped in at Circuit City and then Ultimate Electronics, where I found nothing but blank stares, and finally ending up at the urlLink CompUSA near Beltline. This was clearly the right place, they had an entire section lablelled 'gender-benders', which I thought was pretty cool. The term was used a lot with tech guys and engineers in the 70s and 80s, but I hadn't heard it in a few years and it never really entered the mainstream. As I was about 13 when I first heard the term I found it quite funny, and used it whenever I could. This was also about the time I realized why one was called the male end and the other was called the female end. There was one memorable night when I had to talk my best friend through hooking up a modem and answered his 'which one is the male end?' question with 'think about it dude, think about it.'. Off of my tangent and back to the story, they had gender benders for virtually every type of computer cord in the world, floppy drive cords, printer cables, cords I'm pretty sure are no longer in use, but none for cat5, probably the most used computer cable currently on the market. I said goodbye to my dignity and asked a salesguy for help. 'Genderbender? Genderbender? Ha, I've never heard it called that before, you need a cat5 coupler' Geese dumbass, theres three foot of shelfspace in your store labeled 'gender benders' in size 40 font.... Wow, I typed a lot to relay one little story about a stupid clerk..."

After finishing around 2, Ginger and I went back to her home. The next morning, we went for breakfast. At the resteraunt, we meet Ginger's friend, Heather! After finishing up breakfast, we decided to go to Washington D.C., first to check out the International Spy Museum, but decided not to go after seeing the block long line outside of it. We did get to see the many...many protesters that we up there protest the coming war with Iraq! After going through traffic, we went to Georgetown. While there, Heather took us to a couple of sex shops!! Yes, sex shops! We first went into a S&M clothing shop and we looked around the leather clothing and outfits. We then went to urlLink The Pleasure Place . WARNING, The following is an adult link .....I warned you!!!! Anyway, it seemed to have everything imaginable!!! To be honest, I was neither excited or bothered by what they had there, but I thought it was cool and interesting. I would say for everyone's pleasure! However, I didn't buy anything! After that, we went back to Herndon. After getting back to Herndon, I packed my stuff and headed off to Fairfax to see my friends Nick, Sideburns, and Spiderman Dan. After arriving at their place, I go in to see them, I am suddenly jumped on by Nick....I think he was happy to know I was there!!! Unfortunetly, his sudden and surprising weight cause me to fall down and break the coffee table in the living room! That happened to be the most lively hello I have ever gotten before!!! After mourning over the table...a couple of seconds I think....we headed out to Wendy's for food and came back. Around 7, my friend Rachel came over to visit and hang out. We then headed out to dinner...well just her....to a Chinese restuarant. After finishing, we went by to see my friend Chris working a book store in the same mall. Since he was busy, we went to our friend, Q's townhouse. We stayed and watched the movie Go . When Chris got there, who also lived in the town house, we decided to visit Chris's friend's place. After staying there, not know what to do, for an hour, Nick, Rachel and I came back to Nick's place. During the drive back, we were talking about buying/building a house. The conversation came up because I am in the process of building of house myself. During the conversation, Nick proceeds to say that building a house is scary and that it would mean that my life is over!!! OVER!!! I don't think my life is over, is it!!! It's not like I'm going to get married or have kids.....that doesn't mean that life is over either!!! But to think that life is over because you have the responsibility of owning a home is rediculius! MY LIFE IS NOT OVER!!!! Anyway, that was my weekend! A bit boring but I long needed this trip up to Northern Virginia!"
doc00764,3,"I am a huge movie buff. The passing of Marlon Brando is a great loss for the acting community, for movie goers, and for the people who he knew and touched. Perhaps Brando's most memorable role is Don Vito Corelone. However, his portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee William's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" is what his legacy will give to generations to come. The raw emotion in his face, the gutteral scream that can be heard every year in New Orleans at the ""Stella & Stanley Hollering Contest"" will forever cast him as one of Hollywood's brightest stars. Brando was quite a controversial figure in his lifetime: - He let his stunning good looks which had won him scores of female admirers go at a seemingly early age. - He led an extremely personal and private life - He refused the Best Actor nomination he had won and let a Native American named Sacheen Littlefeather deliver the speech. - Brando had an amazing temper and in Brigette Bardot's Autobiography she recalls an incident where she had dressed up as a maid in a hotel to deliver his breakfast to him and he promptly threw those eggs against the wall and went back to sleep. - In Brando's later years he was living in an apartment alone, facing numerous threatened lawsuits and had a poor public image based on tales of failure to pay his child support. It is better in his passing though to consider the immense library of work that will forever capture him in our hearts and memories.

However, he left his own unique mark on the film's set by apparently telling Frank Oz ""F__K You!"" after Oz gave him some direction. The man was cantankerous as ever. Legendary people have legends that are cultivated over time. Brando's legend will surely never die and his amazing work in nearly every movie role he ever played will shine on for generations to come."

I'll go to USF later and put it all together. Anyone know whats wrong with AOL? I try to go to any website and the window just stays blank, not even an error! EDIT- ok i found a computer that worked so I could get my review from my email. Here it is! George... George Bush... George Walker Bush.... Listen.... WOW! Manchurian Candidate has Oscar landslide written all over it. This movie was awesome. It keeps your attention from beginning to end, has just the right amount of suspense without being overantagonizing, and Meryl Streep deserves an Oscar for her� Hilary-Clinton-meets-Lizzie-Borden Senator part. The movies ending was slightly predictable, yet still suspenseful, and the timing of it all was excellent. I could have done without the occasional reverse-Oedipus complex incestual nuances, but other than that it was awesome, the flashbacks were piercing, and it becomes too realistic to describe. On a funny note, I recognized a strong resemblance of today's incumbent president and cabinet to this movie's plot line. Cheney is Streep's character and it all falls in from there. I wont give away too much. Rating (from 1-5) : 4"
doc00769,3,"I am staring at a post-it note I wrote the last time I got really drunk at my apartment. I smile when I read it, because we all know those horrible thoughts we think about ourselves as that moment of drunken insight. If you think really well of yourself when you are slammed, then you are lucky. I smile, cause I have to, that post-it note has to be wrong. I read this post-it note and I realize it says so much about me. We all have a deep rooted fear that we'd hate it if it were true, so we work so hard to make sure that fear never comes true. But in the back of our head, that thought/fear is there. Really, if that post-it note became the truth, if my fears came to be, I would really be no different than I am now. I move from group to group, my friendships disintegrating. I allow people to treat me horribly and walk all over me. I hope that the group of people I am hanging around with now will be different. They already seem completely different by being as real as they can....that's a good start. My recent friendships have been based on who can impress the most. This miss-spelled post-it still stares at me. And this post-it has been spewing it's venom long before I put the words in writing. It's how I lived my life, it's the reason why I allowed people to treat me the way I did. This 6 worded sentence has wreaked enough havoc in my life. So I ripped it off the wall and tore it up.

doc00771,2,"Okay. So. Fraydie. Normally, Friday nights are planned by Noah. Friday nights usually go smoothly and everyone is home before 10:30. So I made the plans this week. For a brief outline of Friday's events, read on... To be totally honest, I had every reason to expect my plans to fail. After all, it's nothing new; my plans frequently fail due to poor judgement and lack of communication. This week was different. I got to Travis's house about 5:00. We watched VH1 until at least 6:30, and left the house by 7:00 to pick up Kali and Mike. ""Sweet,"" I think. Both Kali and Mike are going to be able to come. On an ordinary friday, neither would be able to come. So, aside from Travis nearly popping a tire on the curb outside of Kali's house, picking the two of them up actually worked. AND we got to the movie theater. Early . What were we there to see? Napoleon Dynamite. This movie surpassed all expectations I had for it - which were considerably high. A must see. After the movie, Chinese food was had by me and Travis while Kali and Mike looked on helplessly... ...at the TV.

doc00772,1,"I drank three forty ounce bottles of beer today. WHY? Why not? Fuck a rhetorical question. You know how good it feels to drink three forties? Not only is it something true hardcore gangstas can accomplish, but it also has a way of aleviating a person's worries and struggles in life. Take my worries and struggles for instance. While I was intoxicated off of my three forties, I laughed, and forgot about why I drank those three forties in the first place. I'm not buzzed anymore. It's been about 8 hours and I finished the last forty about four hours ago. I dont think I'm going to do this every weekend. But, it's a great way to relax. I realized that I'm 24 years old and I'm not in high school anymore. I can go to 7-11, buy a 40, drink it, go back and buy another one, and it's OK. It's only against the law if you get caught drinking a forty while driving your Honda through the suburbs at 4 in the afternoon.

doc00778,1,"Well on Thursday I see the head doctor of the hospital out here to get a firm diagnosis for treatment. I spoke to my psychologist today and she told me that the guy is really nice so hopefully he will be able to help me. I also hope that he will arrive at a diagnosis that I agree with. This is all because my dad wrote a letter to the minister for health complaining about the hospital's treatment of me. But they only treat me bad because of two things 1) they don't agree with my doctors diagnosis and 2) the girl who used to be my friend has copied my symptoms and pretended they are hers, and they happen to believe her and not believe me. I'm serious about that too. She tells me one thing and gets me talking about my symptoms and the next thing I know is that she's telling the hospital that they are hers. And then when I tell them about my problems they tell me that I am faking it. I have gotten so frustrated with her. She pretends that she is really upset to get them to put her in when she is actually doing really well but just wants to avoid exams and so forth. She basically treats the hospital as a hotel that she can check into. Then she gets shirty when they take her off her medication. (Some of which I personally believe that she doesn't need.) The other thing that peeves me about the situation is that they won't put me into the hospital when I really need it unless she isn't in there. And they always put her in the PICU (intensive care unit) although the only reason that she does things like hurt herself is because she wants attention. Unfortunately they taught her right at the beginning that she would get attention if she mucked up so she does. It makes a laughing stock out of the whole system. Why bother to have intake and assessment if they just get fooled by her anyway. I really shouldn't be bitching about her but I need to get these thoughts out of my head and away from my heart where they have been eating away at me. I really hope that by doing this I would manage to free myself from the stress that these thoughts have been placing on me. It's not easy when everyone doesn't take you seriously. I have to get to the point where I'm almost destroying myself before my therapists even think there is something wrong. I hate that. And if I go to the hospital they just tell me to go home and take two valium. It seems to be their equivalent of take two aspirin and I'll see you in the morning. Except they don't even want to see you in the morning. So it's not even worth the time. And so I cry and bleed and hurt and let the sufferring continue. Maybe one day it will become easier. I certainly hope so."
doc00779,4,"You know, last night I read an urlLink interesting article in Wired news, about the effects, if any, of prayer on the physically ill. It's well written and a good read, but most fetching was this paragraph: The time for miracles had run out on Elisabeth Targ. It was a scary moment for the uninitiated, her lungs suddenly gasping for air, trying to hang on, hyperventilating, nearly barking, spasming for more than half an hour. But this literal last gasp is how most die, and Comings knew this, so as he held her in his arms he felt relieved that she would soon be free of the illusion that is this world. This is how my grandma died: a shell, empty inside, gasping for breath not through some desire for life, but because of an uncaring biological imperative. It was disgusting to see this woman who once spoke and laughed and loved reduced to this hollow automation. Thankfully, as in the article, it didn't last. How hard this must have been on Elisabeth's husband as he held her in extremis, torn between having it all mercifully over, and never, ever letting her go. And the worst part of all is that the article says, ""But this literal last gasp is how most die."" I'm sure it's true, but I don't want to believe that life is really so cruel. There's a right to die rant in there somewhere, but I'm going to let it lie. This time."

doc00784,4,"Ordinary people today in my place are thinking about the aftermath of the elections just undergone. These ordinary people (including me, of course) seemed to ignore the early warnings of Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), a national crusade for an honest and orderly elections; as well as the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), a private conduit of the Commission Election to ensure the sacredness of the ballot, not to sell their sacred vote to candidates who are attempting to entice them to do so just to win a seat in the local or even national government elective positions. ""Money talks everytime..."" said a teacher. ""People are really aware that corruption breeds another kind of corruption. The Media has been vigilant enought to remind the voting populace the importance of casting their sacred ballots. They generally tried to condition the minds of the people about responsible voting and even portrayed certain situations about the effects of corrupt voting; but, they refuse to heed..."" she continued. Since the first elections under the 1935 Constitution, breed of corruptions has already been in place. The potential leaders are fighting themselves to gain the upperhand of holding the national government. Maneuvers were undertaken, manipulation of the national consensus about decisions and national policies were railroaded to fit their own whims and caprices in running the government. One of the prominent statesmen, Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth during the American occupation of the Philippines, elusively shouted infront of many spectators: ""It is better to see the Philippines run like hell by the Filipinos rather than like heaven by the Americans!!!"" (Well, I'm not sure if these were really the words he uttered, I just remembered it now...never mind, just get on with it. It's my history thoughts that is failing.) Well said Mr. Quezon...it is really going bad now. Your prophesy seems becoming true today. Even ordinary people is radically high enough to contest the government of such wrongdoings. Ha ha ha...wise enough to learn more about his miscontrued facts. No respect of whoever is holding the position of power. They greatly believed about People Power. What the heck! But examining their utterance, it seems though, money flows within their ranks coming from corrupt government officials or corrupt private moneyed-persons who paid their lot for 3-meals food for the day. I have some information that rallying in the urban centers is now becoming a prosperous business among well-educated or ill-educated people in my country. Money talks, they said. And when money speaks, everybody listen, thence, act. But, of course, there are others who played truthfully the dimensions of their struggle for the sake of the poor. While this could be so, we could not truthfully assure the general public or the potential foreign investors, that the economy is running well. (Well, what's for the economy...my country is going dry...and there's is a great drought going on among truth-seekers, who else could be thinking that this country is getting the greatness that it lost sometime?) As history will teach us the wisdom of learning more to gain more...the aftermath is worst enough to convince me that the decisions of the first statesmen of my country before it gained independence from the Americans WAS RIGHTFULLY WRONG!!!...but what they've done was awfully RIGHT!!! It's a matter of choice between good and evil, and it seems that the choice was between the two warring sides. It means that my country is living within the clutches of both good and evil. (Sigh!) Anyway, going back to the price of selling my sacred vote....I should say that even 1/3 of my countrymen is doing this; another 1/3 is keeping this, and the last 1/3 is highly paying this...the summation would still reflect the rottenness of the hearts of those unscrupulous people who taught the Filipinos to see precious price of gold and silver; who taught the Filipinos to value more of their properties; who taught the Filipinos to study government from other countries and employ the same here in the Philippines; who taught the Filipinos that working abroad is much better than sacrificing a few peso to give it to the paupers; who taught the Filipinos to regain its greatness by empty promises so that others will follow suit; who taught the Filipinos to business as usual that everything they gained from their own practice of profession is worth than to stay stagnant among the poor; who taught the Filipinos that beauty is in the face of everyone that by grabbing the property of the other controls everyone who are living in it; who taught the Filipinos that we do not have our own identify that we belong to the culture of the world and every nations owns us!!!! (What the heck, no one might listen this poor shout...) Okay...I thirst for the truth, really. But what can I do. I don't have to isolate myself from my countrymen; and I hope by doing so, I could learn a lot of wisdom by the way they treated their ownselves.

doc00785,1,"Six years ago a friend from high school and I had decided that February 21st was the most perfect day of the year. Everything was wonderful that day, and since then, all 21 days of each month are gauranteed to be fabulous and February 21st of each year was always looked forward to. Green to Think, The Honorary Title, Wheat, and Hey Mercedes at the Mercury Lounge in New York City. Enough said. I pick up Dan and we went straight for the Wawa for the usual...caffeine, cash, food, gas. That Wawa has been incident free for 213 days, whereas mine is still 69 days. I think during the ride up we both fell in and out of sleep, he was worse off though since he had to work all day and he slept sitting up. Brand New carried us into the city though we sat at the Holland Tunnel for like 25 minutes. We were just in the same area a few days before for the Marlon Spike show at the Knitting Factory, so there was no drama with the driving, for the most part. We go down a side street and I switch with Dan so that he can parallel park my car. During which, Morita called me and passed me off to Steve so I could tell him where we were. First off, Steve should know my issue with knowing where the hell I am. I never get directions right and I never stay in one place, he should know that pinpointing where I am would not be a good idea. So he keeps asking me...no wait - he YELLED AT ME :-P...where I was, but we were parking so all I could see if a billboard and not any signs. Apparently he also put the phone down while I was talking. So I finally get out of the car and tell him where we were and he yelled at me for being at the wrong place. So we get in and drive to where we were supposed to be. So its great that they called to find out where we were because they know me and my destination issues...but NO YELLING!! Dan drives my car to the Merc and we found a perfect **free* parking spot right out front. Chris meets us out front and we dodge traffic to get across the street to Nice Guy Eddie's for food and happy hour. Buy one drink get one free - score. Chris ordered a sandwich and it took about 40 minutes for it to arrive. It was a Cuban sandwich, so it arrived on the boat, hence the lateness. We were all throwing daggers at the waitress. She kept getting sidetracked by the table next to us who were from England or Scotland or somewhere. I kept staring at them listening to them talk, then inform Chris and Dan that if I had an accent, I would talk all the time just to hear myself. Chris asked, ""like you don't already?"". Hey now. Which is when he told me about how mean Steve was by putting down the phone while I was talking. Basketball was on and we were talking about St. Joe's bball. I told them that I used to play basketball and was center. They look at me as if I was crazy since I am a whopping 5'3'' - but I used to be taller then everyone else when I was younger, I just stopped growing haha. Dan: ""If Marlon Spike was a basketball team, I'd be center. Well, we'd need an extra player too."" We get the bill and pay for our food. Dan busted out his wallet, and I noticed it was in two pieces. Chris asked why he doesn't carry just half of his wallet, but Dan needs somewhere to carry his student IDs. His one is practically rubbed off and all you can see is a glowing aura. Chris said it was the man who wasn't there. It took about 5 minutes, but we completely counted the change. Off to the Merc! The show was sold out before the doors even opened. Get inside and see everyone around the bar. So awesome to see everyone again, lets see...it was (because these names will come up again, so I will do it all at once) - Dan, Chris Morita (have to clarify since there are 80 Chris's), Jodie, Ken, Maryellen, Gilligan, Dareen, Dave, DeRose, Katie, Sarah, and Amy. Oh yeah, and mean Steve. :-) It was cute, they all said they were worried I wouldn't make it haha. I informed Steve on his meanness and he laughed and I didn't. Dan spotted that Pabst was on tap and that was the greatest thing at that moment so we took a picture to document the occassion. He couldn't drink the PBR draft, so we got other liquid fun instead. Green to Think was about to take the stage so we all moved from the bar to the venue. I have a tendency to stand centerish leftish, usually between the singer and lead guitar during shows when I have a choice on where to stand, but Dan opted for in front of Chris the bassist. Shit -- too many Chris's. I told him that centerish rightish wasn't as exciting because Chris doesn't move, but on occassion he'll wiggle. Dan laughed and he remembered how excited Maryellen, Dareen, and I were in Philly when Chris actually got his move on. There were some sound issues in the beginning, but by the second song, it was mostly figured out. The last show I saw them play was in Decemeber, but I don't count that since I missed some of it and I was trapped in a sea of teenagers. But the show at the Merc was awesome. Such a talented and great band. I don't get to see them perform that often and the performances I do see are either short opening acts, or at places like Desmonds, or acoustic stuff. So I guess the last full on GTT rock show that I saw was the one at Philly. Hmmm... But yeah, back to the subject. The show was energetic and the new songs sounded awesome and they keep getting better. Kenny always makes me smile because he stands up alot while he plays. (He's the drummer). Dave is rocking out with his legs spread open and I started laughing because it reminded me of the Dewey festival last April. I realized I was laughing to myself at the show and Dareen was behind me so we laughed together. Then they played Sundays, yay. So then I scamper to Maryellen. Let's see, what else was played...1-2-3, We Are Stars, Rockin', Nineteen, And You Dream, a new song (the third song on the setlist), I Don't Think She'll Ever Let Me Be, hmmmm anything else? Steve had some interesting segways between the songs. And he swore on stage when he couldn't get his guitar strap on. Hehe. Strap on. Anyways... The Honorary Title came on next. So good. This was one show where every single band was extremely talented and each brought something unique to the stage. Dan mentioned how reminiscent they were of Bright Eyes, so I liked. I don't remember much about their set aside from the fact that I liked it because I had to pee a lot since I drank a lot of beer. I kept meeting Katie in the bathroom, so it was ok. Dan said he had to buy their CD and I agreed with him. He also got hooked up since he helped carry their keyboard off of the stage. Chris mentioned he was bloated from the Guinness and I was afraid that he ight have exploded. Maryellen and I also made fun of the woman next to has who was wearing a zebra shirt, a mini back pack, and a scrunchie. Dude. WHEAT!! WOOOOO!!!! Have I mentioned how much I love Wheat before? I have to thank Ryan for getting me into this band a while ago. Their new CD is amazing. Everyone came back up for this portion of the night and we were all front and center. And of course Maryellen and I were the dorks who sang along to every word. So the lead singer of Wheat has a staring problem. No wait, its not a problem. But damn, he was fixated on the front for the WHOLE DAMN SHOW. We all kept hitting each other, like ""is this really happening?"". Not that we are new to this whole thing, but it was WHEAT! I was so into this set. Of course when they played Closer to Mercury I turn to Dave and ask if this is the song he doesn't like. Of course it gets quiet when I say that. ARGH! They also played ""don't i hold you"" and I was smitten. Heeeeeeeyyyy Mercedes were the last to play and the highlight of Dan's night. Of course we didn't move and Dan, Chris, and I were right in front of the stage. Dan, Tanya, and I had listened to both of their albums on the way to NYC the Monday before and I had played ""Lets Go Blue"" on my radio show on Friday, and I know thats Dan's favorite song of theirs, so of course we shouted it out. Their performance was awesome. The set flew by and it was great to sing and dance to, and looking around, I think Dan and I were the most into it. We kept shouting out and they said that that was not the right answer, and they played it. Woohoo. They told Dan later that they haven't played that song in months, that rocks. Hang out for a bit after. Steve told me to hold on because he needed his ear plugs to talk to me because I am a loud mouth. That was mean comment #496 from him that night. I am a very quiet person. I was just excited, and the venue was loud. It wasn't me at all. He also bought a kids shirt. This part gets choppy because that is how I remember it. Dan went to get a shirt as well and hands his jacket to Maryellen in which she exclaims ""i'm holding marlon spike coat, i'm holding marlon spike coat!"". It was humorous :-). Talking talking talking...then we leave. Next thing I know Maryellen has my keys and we leave for Hoboken with Amy and we talk about fashion in the backseat. Go to bed sometime and wake up at 7:30 am. Ugh. Dan and I hit up the Dunkin Donuts and discover that the egg and cheese sandwich is $.99 and that was the perfect breakfast meal when you have only slept a few hours and you are about to drive some more. I got from exit 14C to 1 in an hour. I was so sleepy that I think my foot just fell on the pedal. We listened to the Postal Service and Dan mentioned how it sounded like getting coins in a video game. I am sure I will add more later. But for now, I am tired. And cold. My heat isn't on again."

doc00787,3,"Well, it's over. Last Sunday , July 18, 2004 was my first triathlon: 325 yard swim, 11.5 mile bike, 3.25 mile run. My Time was 1 hour 18 minutes 16 seconds. Not terrible. I was in the top 3/4's. It was very fun, very intense, and much harder than I expected. Training in the gym helps, but I realized I need to train more intensly. In my training I focused on doing two things: swim then run. I trained bike/run only twice, and it wasn't even on my bike, but a gym stationary. I thought concentrating on swim and run would compensate for my weaknesses. I just didn't realize how weak I was on the bike. I started to realize it the week before the Tri when I biked 10 miles then ran 3.25. It was an eye opener. It took me about 5 minutes to recover from the bike while I was running. By then it was too late to really train that way. Oh well, live and learn. I will be training differently for next year. The biggest surprise for me was the swim, which was in a lake as opposed to a pool. Just a hint for anyone else doing their first time tri, train in the lake as much as possible. Advice point number 2- really concentrate on relaxing. This is how it happens. You get in the lake with the people in your heat. My heat consisted of 46 guys between 35-39. The horn blows then you are diving in, trying to avoid getting kicked, and trying to keep up with or pass everyone else. You also realize how murky the water is, even with gogles, and that you have to lift your head up out of the water completely to see where you are going. By the time I go to the first bouy I realized I had been sprinting the whole way, and was out of breath, and holding my head out of the water was getting harder, and messing up my rythm. This forced me to alternate between breast stoke and freestyle, made it difficult to get my breath back, and just pissed me off. The rest of the race went much better. The bike was much harder than the meager training I had done for it. Switching gears and such, but ah well more taining! It was very exhilaratinig. I was amazed at how good it felt to pass people too, and how sucky it was to get passed. The competitive spirit is deep. The run was my best event. 3.25 miles in 27 minutes 08 seconds. Not my best, but I was happy. One thing I really liked about the Triathlon was the supportive attiude of the other athletes, and the spectators. As I was finishing up the run I tried to sprint as fast as I could. I came around the second to the last bin, going up hill to the fininsh, with lots of people cheering me, and those in front of me on, and I heard a guy, I imagine one of the guys who already finished, he sounded like a coach, a very authoritative voice, called out to me, ""Way to dig 216!"" Then a few seconds later I was done. There was a fire truck spewing water high into the air so people could cool down after the race. I shambled ove to the merciful fountain, in a daze, with those word echoing in my head. In fact I have been hearing echos of them all week. Now, a week later almost I feel strangely empty. The goal I had been working towards for the last few months is not there anymore. There are a couple more events in my area, but they both have signifigantly longer swims; I think I will wait until next year to try them. What a great experience though. Can't wait for next year. If you're interested here are the numbers: Overall place out of 333 : 175 Age group : 35- 39 Swim 325 yards: 7:40 Place: 217 Bike 11.5 Miles: 43:29 Place: 189 Run 3.25 Miles: 27:08 Place: 152 Overall Time: 1:18:16"

The protagonist of this book is Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinaski. His character is completely repulsive in almost every way and yet I couldn't put the book down. The idea of sex became mildly disgusting after reading a chapter and when I finished reading the last word of the book on christmas eve I closed the paperback and kind of shuddered. And yet, I find myself ready to read another of his books, perhaps the more famous ""Post Office"" or ""Ham on Rye."" Part of the attraction is his really simplistic style of storytelling. It's really quite exquisite. No extra bullshit whatsoever. But the other phenomenon is the old train-wreck syndrome.

doc00808,6,"...Than grow old. In the past few weeks I have spent some time at different medical institutes. In each one of these offices, I bring down the average age substantially. Typically, I am surrounded by elderly people - in wheelchairs, or using walkers, or with scabs on their skin, or shaking uncontrollably, or barely hearing, or in apparent pain. It's always been my uttermost fear - the fear of old age. (I wonder if there is a formal term for this phobia). What kind of life is it - to have no control over your body, to be dependent on others. No life. At least not one worth living. I have told my husband repeatedly - I would rather die. As soon as I can not care for myself, my body, or my soul - I want OUT. I've gotta find a way to make it legal. Have some lawyer just put a bullet through my forehead. I hope I don't have one of those ""humanitarian"" kids who want to keep me around for the sake of their conscience... (Maybe I need to make sure they have a killer inheritance - they won't want to wait too long). I found this response from some doctor on the web - written to a lady with fear of old age: Ageing can be either seen as growing old or growing wiser. Old age brings wisdom and experience of the years, which can be of great benefit to the youth. It all depends on how you live your life today, physically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. Ageing is inevitable and this reality cannot be changed. What can be changed is how we age. We can either age gracefully and with wisdom, or then we can age with resistance and fear. The only thing you can do is to keep yourself physically fit with good nutrition and exercise, of course without getting obsessed with fitness, because no one is &lsquo;age-proof&rsquo; and immortal. To keep fit psychologically, you could exploit your creative potential, practice relaxation techniques like Yoga etc., develop hobbies, and develop a sense of humour to see the lighter side of things. Socially you can keep fit by developing good interpersonal relationships, which are meaningful and fulfilling, you could engage in some social work to give back to society. This can be deeply fulfilling. On a spiritual level, you could work towards having an &lsquo;emotional closure&rsquo; in all your relationships, by forgiving and asking forgiveness for all the hurts caused by others to you and by you to others, by prayer and meditation, and by finding and fulfilling the purpose of your life. Your past has formed your present, and your present will form your future. Be the best of who you can be in the &lsquo;here and now&rsquo; because that is what is in your hands, and then leave the rest. Here is a prayer of St. Francis for you, which I hope will give you strength. O Lord, Give me the courage to change the things that I can, The Serenity to accept the things that I cannot change, And the Wisdom to know the difference."

doc00819,2,"Having just recently discovered the joy of blogs, I decided to start my own. This decision was not a result of me believing my thoughts merited other people's time or interest, but rather it forces me to write those thoughts down. Yes, I know that's what a journal is for, but in a journal I tend to write more of what happened to me that day than what I was thinking about that day. Of course, when you go back and read, the thoughts are far more interesting than the events. Another reason I am starting this is because I have been Gospel Doctrine teacher in my ward here in Brooklyn for the past year and have just been called as early morning seminary teacher for the coming school year. I feel that this might serve as an appropriate place to express thoughts and hopefully receive ideas and/or feedback. I am in my element when teaching Gospel Doctrine. Seminary, however, is not Gospel Doctrine. A quick explanation of the name of my blog: nine moons is the amount of time Coriantumr spent with the people of Zarahemla. Considering the cultural differences but spiritual similarities, I can only imagine the discussions they had in those nine months. Mormon blogs fascinate me because I love to see the different cultural perspectives of members from all over the world discussing Gospel principles."

I told them we would charge them rent if that made them feel more comfortable and respectable. ;) Patti and I will pack up her room at her parents house on this upcoming weekend and then have all of her stuff (bedroom and storage) moved in by the end of the month. It will take a few trips, even with the Jeep, truck, and rented trailer, but it will finally be done. Hopefully, the housewarming party will happen by the end of August. We've already come up with a cool contest idea for the party (not sharing it with you yet) and our wish list for the house is enormous. Patti and I have been putting a lot of time and effort into the landscaping of the house and preparing it for some of our ideas. She's done an incredible job working over a lot of the land and cleaning things up. We estimate that we can start our cactus garden in 2 - 3 weeks and we are looking at ways of removing the tons of lava rock all over the property. I've been on bug detail for a couple of months and go around smelling like pesticide. Everytime someone spots an ant anywhere outside, I'm called in with the sprayer to be John Goodman. Its fun and chemically educational! Other than that fun stuff, my parents things get packed up on Wednesday and shipped out on Thursday. They'll be staying in a hotel until the 21st and then they board a plane for Buffalo. On the 16th, they'll be returning to the house to help do a lot of the cleaning (since all the furniture will be gone). Oddly, the house will be nearly devoid of furniture for over a week since we're not moving Patti's stuff until the weekend of the 23rd. I called most of the utilities today and taken the necessary steps to have the accounts put into my name. But it looks like we'll save a nice chunk of change if we switch to SBC for phone service and get their DSL service. I'll tackle that tomorrow."

doc00824,2,"Why Pennsyltucky Should Not Run Pennsylvania I�m hardly a romantic, but the snow today, which kept me away from the newspaper for a second day, was very soothing and beautiful. Probably more because the mostly untouched snow did a great job of covering up the trash and sending the homeless indoors. An AP story coming across the wire this weekend detailed Temple University's plans to offer same-sex benefits to it employees and the subsequent disapproval by state elected officials. The story wasn't carried on any online news source, so you�ll have to take my word for it. The story quoted a state Representative (of western Pennsylvania) in Harrisburg who wants to fully ""defund"" Temple (Temple is officially a quasi-state funded university - i.e. it received significant funding from the state). The representative also said he had colleagues who would support his move. Bad! I'm currently reading ""Rise of the Creative Class"" by a very egotistical Richard Florida. It's an urban studies book and it notes that many thriving ""creative centers"" attract the gay population. Florida also notes that many businesses offering same-sex benefits attract other ""creative people"" because it shows the institution is tolerant and supportive. Offering same-sex benefits can attract many people outside the gay population because of this, which Temple President David Adamany noted in the story. While I do not support gay marriage (and most marriage actually) - it's been a religious-based ceremony since the beginning of time and has always been between a man and a woman - I do support same-sex benefits. I have been unable to find references to gay marriage in ancient Greece, probably the first bastion of a gay culture, which leads me to believe it hasn't ever existed in a truly accepted and popular form. Temple's benefit plan, however much anyone wants to criticize it, is strict enough. Shared property and other proof of a couple living together and committed to each other for the long term is required. Philadelphia is also the liberal stronghold in Pennsylvania, and a few other local colleges have offered same-sex benefits. This should not be surprising, nor should it be met with such strong disgust from the people running our government. These days, laws and regulations seem to impose one view�s morals rather than everyone�s fairness. Providing same-sex benefits does not take anything from other groups, it merely levels a playing field. Why is this a problem? It is this kind of opposition in the state that fuels our shriveling, graying population, while other cities, other states flourish. People are not fleeing because of the weather. I�m still here! And while on the topic of marriage, ABC reports on some of the bizarre urlLink marriage rituals of yore."

doc00831,1,"Nothing&nbsp;beats being panned by the critics!&nbsp;When following your dreams you get sentimentally scorched by&nbsp;lots of overly-groomed seemingly&nbsp;educated Dragons who like to discourage you from creating and producing. Dragons, as Joseph Campbell notes, are people who hoard things, like feeble-wristed&nbsp;PHD candidates: &nbsp; ""They&nbsp;hoard heaps of golds (books in their office) and beautiful virgins (Their students) and they don't know what to do with either of them. They just hang on."" &nbsp; Here's a quote from the writer almanac for all my lovers and gypsy dreamers out there about J.D. Salinger and how the incendiary&nbsp;Dragon known as the book critic&nbsp;endeavored to scorch his budding career. &nbsp; ""Giroux didn't hear back from Salinger for months, and then, one day, Salinger walked into his office. Giroux said, ""A tall, sad-looking young man with a long face and deep-set black eyes walked in, saying, 'It's not my stories that should be published first, but the novel I'm working on ... about this kid in New York during the Christmas holidays.'"" Giroux said he'd love to publish it, but when it was finished one of his superiors thought the kid in the book seemed too crazy. So Salinger published The Catcher in the Rye with Little, Brown and Company, and it came out on this day in 1951. &nbsp; The New York Times ran a review titled ""Aw, the World's a Crumby Place"" that poked fun at Salinger's style. The New Yorker refused to run any excerpts of the novel, because they said that the children in it were unbelievably intelligent, and the style of the novel was too ""showoffy."" But despite the mixed reviews, The Catcher in the Rye reached the bestseller list after being in print just two weeks, and it stayed there for more than six months. It has gone on to sell more than sixty million copies. It has been at one time or another the most banned book in America and one of the most assigned books in American classrooms.&nbsp;"" &nbsp; &nbsp; In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche utilizes the image of the Dragon as the ""ultimate"" nemesis from which the ever-fluctuating&nbsp;spirit of mankind must devour if it is to be spiritually transformed. &nbsp; According to Nietzsche, the spirit of mankind is always in a state of constant matamorphic flux. Quick synopsis (very quick)=The spirit of mankind has three stages. The first of that is a camel. &nbsp; A camel is an animal&nbsp;carrying substantial&nbsp;loads and burdens. Think of the young wayward artist cultivating his own aesthetic and ideas.&nbsp; Traveling by himself. Working for a goal. Spending hours alone in meditation, intriscally seeking. That's camel work. &nbsp; Once the Camel is piled&nbsp;full the camel sets out to the Desert.&nbsp;A desert is a place of spiritual incubation.&nbsp;Numerous Manifestations have at one time or another, been swallowed in the arid sand of the&nbsp;desert. Christ fasted in the desert. The Israelites soaked up a few decades meandering around the desert searching for their collective ethos. Yeah.... the desert is a place, like the womb,&nbsp; demarcated for spiritual growth and change. &nbsp; In the desert the camel transforms into a LION. The more loaded the camel, the more aggressive and potent the Lion. ""If&nbsp;it wants to capture freedom and be lord in its own desert""&nbsp; Basically,&nbsp;be master of&nbsp;his/her own creativity. That which is latent inside his bones aching to crawl out. &nbsp; The Lion has a job, the lions job is to KILL&nbsp;a golden-scaledDragon whose name is THOU SHALT.&nbsp; Dragon's, as previously noted,&nbsp;can be seen as&nbsp;individuals who are ""stuck"" in a certain&nbsp;spiritual purgatory for so long that&nbsp;their soul's become inflated and their hearts transition into sort've a waiting room.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my profession, the Dragon is the publisher who tells me ""Sorry,&nbsp;not what we're looking for"" and slips me a bussiness card for a local ad copying agent.&nbsp; But the Dragon is also the&nbsp;hoity-toity&nbsp;prof. who, as Ezra Pound says, ""One avg. mind, with one&nbsp;less average thought each&nbsp;year""....basically prof.'s whose only claim to fame is&nbsp;making a carrer forged from&nbsp;footnotes to other people's genius.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It's stitched&nbsp;in the Dragon's nature to mentally&nbsp;thwart the budding soul of the creative individual in as much that the dreamer will succumb, grow hard cold scales and transition into an inwardly opinionated&nbsp;DRAGON&nbsp;himself. &nbsp; Once the LION kills the Dragon the LION transitions into a child. With the child everthing is new and innocent. A child continues to badger out querries. A child continues to always look at the world as if it were a new creation and everything the child touches feels fresh in his grip.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Keep the chin up on &nbsp;your crazy heart and keep slicing&nbsp;apart the Dragon, one delicious scale at a time. children (smiles)"

doc00834,3,"My, how times flies when you are having fun. It seems as if we just got back from our trip to Texas back on last Tuesday. Now it is Saturday afternoon and I am sitting here writing to you about our trip to Goose Creek SC. Loading the truck only claimed two victims and a couple of scratches for two people. No major injuries and we only damaged two pieces of furniture. The joys of moving a lot is that ultimately things are going to get torn up no matter how hard you try to keep it from happening. The trip between Travelers Rest and Goose Creek was uneventful and it was not until we landed in Goose Creek around 9pm that things got fun. I took the UHaul truck to the UHaul center to off load the car carrier. There was not enough space in the main parking lot for me to turn the truck around while pulling the car carrier. What to my wandering eyes appeared but a field behind the main parking lot. At first glance things looked dry and I also found several trailers parked in the field. I deducted that it was safe to drive the 26' truck off into the field so I could turn it around. What I should have done was put the truck in park and walked into the field myself to VERIFY that it was indeed safe to do so. For a fleeting moment my brain told me to question my assumption but you know what folks say about assumptions. It took me approximately 35 seconds to leave the concrete and come to a complete stop while the truck was still in drive and trying to go forward. I tried and tried to rock the truck forward and backward thinking I could disengage it from the soft mud that I encountered. They say that the road to perdition is paved with good intentions but no matter how many good intentions that I may have had the truck was going no where. By this time I had several on lookers who happened to be at the Goose Creek EMS next door. I think that they probably had bets as to how quickly I would get the truck stuck in the mud. I would also believe that they probably have a wall in their garage that has a mark for every time a Uhaul driver has gotten a truck stuck in that very same field. It is one thing to make a stupid mistake but something entirely different to have to broadcast it to friends or family when you call for help. They always say ""You did what? What in the world were you thinking James?"" Thanks be unto good manners the laughter was kept to a minimum and my friend , Paul Bunyon, and several EMS workers used a Chevy 4x4 and a chain and pulled the truck out of the mud. I know that you are wondering about who Paul Bunyon is. I want to give him credit for helping me but in order to finish the next paragraph I have to protect his true identity so that I can finish this story. Paul Bunyon , my tree felling friend, is an integral part of this story. We spent the night at the Pastors house and got some much needed rest for all of the sore and aching body parts. Thanks to the help of about 10 people from church we had the truck unloaded in approximately 1 hour. I am so thankful for the help and assistance that we have received from our friends and church family. Daniel Boone was a man he was a BIG Man..... Oh, I am sorry, I wandered a bit. I was supposed to tell you about my friend , Paul Bunyon, the great outdoorsman, a REAL man. Paul Bunyon IS a REAL MAN. I am not kidding. This guy can work from sun up to sun down and there is almost NOTHING that this guy can not do with his bare hands. Ok, ok, maybe I am exagerrating a bit. Sometimes he does need to use tools. Can we say power tools? Tim the tool man would be jealous of Paul's prowess with power tools. Today is no different than most days with regards to my memory of how talented my friend Paul is with regards to his strength, agility and endurance. Not only did he help unload the 26' truck he also hauled all the trash out of our yard into a large burn pile. Paul Bunyon then proceeds to fire up the chain saw and started cutting down trees out of the neighbors yard in preparation for moving out an older trailer and making room for a more new improved and newer LARGER trailer. I KNOW that the lady in the shoe box across the street will be absolutely thrilled but that is a whole different story. I know, I chase too many rabbits in my writing but I know that it probably keeps you on your toes. Why make writing dull and boring anyway? Lest I digress lets get back to why the power tools and Paul Bunyon are so important to this story. Just as I did not MEAN to bury the truck in mud my friend Paul did not MEAN to cut down the tree and certainly did not expect the tree to take out the power on our entire street. Did you ever wonder how to get all your neighbors out into the street all at the same time? Try killing the power on your street and you will have more friends than you would ever want. When the power went off I was under my desk amidst all of the different power cords and connectors that have to be plugged in to get all of my computer toys functional again. There are three things that happen first when it comes to getting the household functional after first moving in. Katy works on the kitchen (food) and food making utensils. The computer network and all the essentials for getting online fast. (Must have access) and the stereo equipment comes next. We must have tunes. If we have food, Internet Access and tunes we can survive anything. Well, anything but friends with a hankering to cut down trees in the middle of the day with their power tools."

doc00838,5,"Heh, that's a funny definition for the word, ""trip,"" is it not? Nevertheless, it's not the one with which I'm concerned right now.

My family and I are going to Washington, D.C. tomorrow. That means I get to ride in the back of the family van all by myself and enjoy my music and enjoy my magazines and enjoy my breath mints whilst I enjoy staring out the window into nothingness. I like time to myself, because I'm insane. I'm going to get caught up with all of the reading I should have been doing the past two years.

Reading doesn't seem like such a huge part of my life now like it once used to be. Of course, I now have more important things to do, like talk to you and pick my nose with tire irons. Stoop-o-rific, spin-doodalee-astic. Trip time. I'm gonna trip. Dude. And then, the next stop will be the place that we all love. You probably have a tee shirt in your closet proclaiming your love for the location. Yep, we are going to New York. I've never been there, and I am looking forward to it, but I don't think the van will enjoy getting hit so many times by the cabbies. I heard from someone once that they aren't too careful about stuff like that. Does anyone here have any knowledge as to whether or not this is a fact? Will I get killed by a cab driver in New York? What if I'm allergic to apples? Right now, my eardrums are vibrating their hairs off with the sounds of Aphrodite's Drum and Bass remix of ""The Luniz - I Got Five On It."" I seem to have recently acquired a taste for the D&B style. I just like to imagine that I'm doing the remixing in the auditorium at my school and all of the students are there cheering me on and drinking soda-pop, because when I do remixes, I sell soda-pop, and that's just what I do.

doc00841,3,"Features of Cockney English: Some of the more characteristic features of the Cockney accent include the following: Monophthongization This affects the lexical set mouth vowel. MOUTH vowel Wells (1982b) believes that it is widely agreed that the ""mouth"" vowel is a ""touchstone for distinguishing between ""true Cockney"" and popular London"" and other more standard accents. Cockney usage would include monophthongization of the word mouth Example: mouth = mauf rather than mouth Glottal stop Wells (1982b) describes the glottal stop as also particularly characteristic of Cockney and can be manifested in different ways such as ""t"" glottalling in final position. A 1970’s study of schoolchildren living in the East End found /p,t,k/ ""almost invariably glottalized"" in final position. Examples: cat = up = sock = It can also manifest itself as a bare as the realization of word internal intervocalic /t/ Examples: Waterloo = Wa’erloo City = Ci’y A drink of water = A drin' a wa'er A little bit of bread with a bit of butter on it = A li'le bi' of breab wiv a bi' of bu'er on i'. As would be expected, an ""Estuary English"" speaker uses fewer glottal stops for t or d than a ""London"" speaker, but more than an RP speaker. However, there are some words where the omission of ‘t’ has become very accepted. Examples: Gatwick = Ga’wick Scotland = Sco'land statement = Sta'emen network = Ne’work Dropped ‘h’ at beginning of words (Voiceless glottal fricative) In the working-class (""common"") accents throughout England, ‘h’ dropping at the beginning of certain words is heard often, but it’s certainly heard more in Cockney, and in accents closer to Cockney on the continuum between that and RP. The usage is strongly stigmatized by teachers and many other standard speakers. Examples: house = ‘ouse hammer = ‘ammer TH fronting Another very well known characteristic of Cockney is th fronting which involves the replacement of the dental fricatives, and by labiodentals [f] and [v] respectively. Examples: thin = fin brother = bruvver three = free bath = barf Vowel lowering Examples: dinner = dinna marrow= marra Prosody The voice quality of Cockney has been described as typically involving ""chest tone"" rather than ""head tone"" and being equated with ""rough and harsh"" sounds versus the velvety smoothness of the Kensington or Mayfair accents spoken by those in other more upscale areas of London. Cockney Rhyming Slang Cockney English is also characterized by its own special vocabulary and usage in the form of ""cockney rhyming slang"". The way it works is that you take a pair of associated words where the second word rhymes with the word you intend to say, then use the first word of the associated pair to indicate the word you originally intended to say. Some rhymes have been in use for years and are very well recognized, if not used, among speakers of other accents. Examples: ""apples and pears"" – stairs ""plates of meat"" – feet There are others, however, that become established with the changing culture. Example: ""John Cleese"" – cheese ""John Major"" - pager Numerous examples and usage of rhyming slang can be found online. See Note 2 for information."

The other day, my friends fired one young Australian Graduate less than 2 months after hiring him. Reasons : this young graduate is only interested in online games, not able to meet deadline, and always on MSN in the office. Another online gamers suck the dusts !!! Regulating cybercafe business a better option July 2: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I REFER to the report ""Addicted to cyber-fantasy"" (NST, June 28) and the letter ""Hishammuddin missing the point"" (NST, June 25). Addiction in any form is bad. Addiction to online games is a serious form of social illness. Smoking is bad for health and we enacted a law to prohibit the sale of cigarettes to minors and are conducting a campaign to encourage smokers to quit the habit. Drink driving is dangerous and we enacted legislation to enforce penalties for those caught driving drunk. We recognised that not all movies are suitable for the public, so we established a censorship board to review their contents prior to their release to the public. Likewise, cybercafes by themselves do not cause social problems, but they are a contributing factor if they are not regulated. Banning cybercafes only deprives genuine operators from providing legitimate information technology services to the local community. It is the responsibility of local authorities to introduce guidelines, review their appropriateness and enforce them to ensure cybercafes operate within the legal framework. In this regard, I would like to suggest that the local authorities consider the following: * Ensure those under the legal age are not allowed into cybercafes; * Ensure cybercafes are not located too close to schools, colleges, and universities; * Ensure cybercafes operate within reasonable hours; and, * Limit the number of cybercafes under their jurisdiction. With regard to online games, not all are bad. But there are also online games with deceptive ill intent. The point is how many parents are capable of discerning the suitability of online games? I would like to suggest that the authorities implement the following: * Empower the Film Censorship Board to review the contents and classify online games before their release to the public; * Block access to online games from midnight to 9am; * Ensure the online game provider obtains prior parental consent with regard to selling game subscriptions to minors; and, * Conduct talks and a campaign to inform and advise on the dangers of game addiction.

I have to get the house cleaned because since my parents aren't here, as well as my sister, it gives me time to organize. The way to my heart is through functionality, organization, and style. Which explains many things about myself. The reason I am in love with my car (functionality). The reason I sometimes am anal retentive and meticulous (organization). And why I want to be an interior designer (style). SO IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW DISPLAYS THESE SKILLS THEN PLEASE CALL: 1-800-TAKE BEN. Enough.

doc00855,2,"So who's annoying me today? People who think they are better or know more because they have money or the ability to speak another language or any other number of things that would differentiate them from someone else. Over on the urlLink Spruce Creek High School alumni board , there's a guy who has taken it upon himself to rant about my views and correct what he views as my misconceptions. And a good debate is never something I back away from, as those of you who know me know very well. However, it's the forum he has chosen that irks me. Here's the deal: I posted on the site letting people know that I got married and have a new last name, etc. Perfectly innocent post. The site administrator allows us to link to a site from our post, so I linked here, thinking people who know me and care enough to read the post might be curious about my Web site. Apparently this guy read my post and clicked on the link, and the things I say here irked him so much, he felt the need to bash me on that forum. Now, I ask you, what is the purpose in that? I provide a way to respond right here on the site. The only thing I can think might be his purpose is just to let people know how smart, successful, etc., he may or may not be while bashing me. How else is he going to mention for the hundredth time that he is worth tons of money, knows another language, is wildly successful, whatever, without sounding like a pompous ass? If that's not the reason, what is? If anyone else can think of a good reason, I would love to know it. Otherwise, someone should clue him in to the fact that he's not the only one in the U.S. with money, he's not the only one who can speak another language (He hablado una lengua otra por muchos anos, y no es dificil - insert tildas and accents where you will, my computer won't do it for me.) and he's not the only one who is successful in a given field. And just because he is doesn't mean he can attack other people. OK, I shouldn't use the word can. He can do whatever he wants. It just makes him an ass. Not to mention that some of his posts were personal attacks, which never make for good debate. Now, his vile posts have been removed, but some of his cronies (or him posing as his friends) are pissed that my initial post has not been removed because it contains the link to this site, which they don't like. They are continuing to post attacks, and they are still being unnecessarily personal in their gripes. And they are missing one key point: My post says that I got married. In order to read that information, you don't need to click on this link. It's all a matter of the proper time and place to post your views. This is proper. That site isn't. And if any of you are reading this site and are still not happy, by all means, pick the proper place to respond. Right here, where it belongs. Don't take it over to a site that, until you came around, was a great place to be."

doc00861,6,"Ok, if you are just hearing about this some background will be provided. There is this douchebag Ken Brown who is writing a paper about the origins of open source and linux. You can find his M$ funded and puppeted institute urlLink here . Anyway....Brown writes a very uninspiring peice accusing Linus of ""stealing"" a majority of code from Andy Tanenbaum's Minix OS. In the end all the major open source playas (torvalds, tanenbaum, and raymond) got to take their respective shots at this M$ sock-puppet Ken Brown and the shit rag he wrote. I will provide the links to all rebutles of Brown's paper b/c the links on the ADTI site are mysteriously unavailable. See urlLink here. And they are far more eloquent at tearing Brown apart than I could do justice. Here are all the comments, hopefully in order urlLink Linus Torvalds urlLink Andy Tanenbaum urlLink Eric Raymond -this is priceless! While Brown's paper ""Samizdat"" is an obvious jab at the open-source movement (and a troll and major flambait and outright disregard for veritas), even before it's public release, it has prompted a wave of concern in the Open community in regards to the auditing of source/kernel changes and who is responsible. New measures have already been instituted to ensure that developers ""sign off"" on code they have worked on or reviewed. FUD is still the reason most Open projects have no place yet in corporate IT environments. When will managers wake up and realize that behind all the pagentry and propaganda at M$, there is nothing but subpar programming/development, smoke, and mirrors. And while we are on the topic of ""borrowing"" code, M$ is responsible for some of the greatest borrowing of all time, like Berkely's TCP/IP stack. Also, I would like to point out that Windows-centric environments with all there helping-hand config wizards creates the ""i dunno it just works that way"" attitude. This inturn creates a generation of ""dumb"" sysadmins...and you wonder why 18 yo. kids can take down these companies with 200 lines of code. How's that for FUD."

doc00864,6,"Am writing this trilogy of sorts.. my views about myself in the past year and going forward.. the first one is ""The year that was"" for the past year... this would be followed by two more... about the present and one about the future... ----------- As I look upon the last 48 hrs of this year... I'm overcome by a strange avalanche of mixed feelings.. its been a year sans anything dramatic.. most of that is to do with my lazy attitude about going about my life and living.. which seems to take new turns every now and then... This year saw some relationships become hazy and some new ones that seem more precious than anything... I got to know new people and understood some people better... and felt for doing so at times... Ignorance sure is bliss..!! This year did teach me some new lessons on how to cope with life... and why one should not be as lazy as me... My career has steadied myself and channelled my plans and thinking to a very significant extent... I can call myself a ""fresher"" no more... feels happy to know I've grown up.. but that also means increased responsibilities... somtimes I wonder why do we ever grow up.. why can't we always be the cute little kids for our parents... and such childish wishes still continue.. there is still a lot of child in me... But that has not deterred my ""futuristic"" thinking... I feel I have grown stronger.. but yet to have enough tests to validate that... a bit of arrogance has also creeped slowly in... I try to use this as positive as possible though... but, after all, I'm just a human being... I become too much of a future planner at times... and try to make unnecessary ""sacrifices""... may be because, I'm still learning to distiguish between some of my wants and needs... Its been just another year in my life... the first one that I spent as a ""working lad"" in its entirety... with most of my time devoted to ""learning the trade""..."
doc00865,5,"I shot a 97. Don't really want to talk about it much, which is ironic because, as a defense mechanism, I think, I talk way too much during a bad round of golf as a way of rationalizing the stress of poor performance. I started on the tenth tee today which was bad because I never had any idea how to play the tenth hole. So I just started by hitting my first drive OB. I never really recovered despite basically birdieing the hole with my second ball. A quad on the 18th right before the turn with two water balls hurt and made me turn in a 50 for the back side. I finally got something of a rhythm going on the second hole (my eleventh) after hitting a provisional for a lost ball but then finding it. The thing was that I just couldn't get the ball in the hole in par. I missed some fairways, but the fairways I did hit I missed the green on, or if I did in fact get a green (the fourth) I three putted. I missed a few short putts, but my putting total was lower, probably because instead of hitting the green but far from the pin, I miseed the green. The course was playing much tougher, I must say, because the tees were pretty much from the tips, and the wind was blasting hard. I really screwed up the par threes over water, doubling both. The eleventh I four putted from fifty feet above the hole (first putt long onto the fringe, second putter caught by rough, third missed, fourth tap-in), and the fifth I put my ball in the front bunker, took two shots to get out, and then two putted. It was very hot out there today, my shirt was wet and my hands too. One guy in my group fired a 78-73 to make it to the match play round of the tournament. He was one deep for the front nine, and had a chip in birdie to complement three bogeys on the back side. Props to a great course, great organization, two extra tournament rounds of golf, Ed Traines for firing a one over 72-73 to go to the match play portion probably seeded first. Anti Props (someone tell me the real word for these) for the bad greens, the lack of a driving range at the course, and the hot weather. PS My new two clubs are straightening out a bit"
doc00866,6,"Miriam (Congratulations, BTW), you are making some gross, as in large, assumptions concerning the looting. You assume that we were in the area of the museum(s) when they were looted. Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew. But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts? Shoot them? Beat them with the butts of rifles? The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control. They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus). They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone. Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.

Its not about sex, you can have sex with anyone and have an alright time, for me its about two people broadening each others horizons and making their days a little different.

doc00874,3,"This song is sung by one of my most favorite rock bands and “his” favorite too, Linkin Park. It’s about breaking away from something that you have been loving obsessing about because it hurts you so much, resistance is futile and no matter how much you say that you can fight for it, you no longer can. When I took a quiz on the net, the results said that this song is for the one I love, or let’s call him my ex-ai. It’s also a coincidence that this band is also my ex-ai’s favorite. I find this song appropriate because the band clearly expressed the pain and confusion when you have to let go of something you found to be part of your “daily dose”, when you have to “break away from the habit”. I am not a drug addict, but the way I have been obsessing about my ex-ai is like a woman hooked on marijuana and heroine since her childhood years. I’m not exaggerating, I guess it’s just like that when you’re in love with someone who treats you like another stranger in their life… you keep on being rejected, the stronger is the surge to get him. At first, it was just your normal dose then as days go by, the drive increases until it becomes a habit which eventually turns into addiction. Of course it hurts to have all my love be fixated exclusively for one person only, but who cares? Even if I’m being called brainless despite my high IQ, I really don’t care… the only thing I care about is I see my ex-ai and talk to him, which I always thought would turn out be something more serious than that. Memories consume Like opening the wounds I’m picking me apart again You all assume I’m safe here in my room Unless I try to start again The first stanza, oh yes… it’s all about the memories and the pain and the façade. The whole entourage is here. I tried to forget him, really I did. I have collected all the things I have which remind me of him and ask my best friend to keep it. I have written him a six-page long letter on how I fell for him, love him and eventually hate myself for loving him, but that letter was just kept in my drawer, and I always read it that’s why memories always come back to haunt me. Whenever I see him it all comes back, the times when he tried to make friends with me, when my friend told me that he liked me when I was still a freshman in high school, when he smiles at me and when he fools around with me. All these memories and so much more are just ripping me apart into pieces. It hurts me so much just to think about him. I tell my friends that I don’t care a bit about him but the truth us just I put on a brave face so that they won’t know how foolish I am when it comes to love. They all think that I have moved on because I am now diverting my attention to other guys, but the truth is… it’s all just an act. When I’m alone though you think I’m alright, I’ll never be alright. I don’t want to be the one The battles always choose Cause inside I realize That I’m the one confused Now we have the refrain, yes I am confused. I don’t know how the heck I got myself in this position but I’m here so there’s no turning back. At this point, though I am going into another phase in my life, I can’t seem to let go of that past which clings tightly unto me, but a part of me says that I have to, for my own good. I feel so torn between the mixed feelings I have. It’s driving me crazy up to the point I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing. I don’t want to be put in this kind of situation but it is fate that chose that I have to deal with this and while I’m at it, fate decided to give me a taste of hell. Clutching my cure I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more that anytime before I have no options left again Before I proceed to the chorus, let’s go to the second line first. I have a cure, or at least a temporary one. It’s redirecting my attention to other guys who I see, which end up being temporary diversion only. But the more I try to deny all the feelings I have inside and the more I try to use my cure, the greater is the pain. I just end up comparing the guys I meet to him and I just give any guy who comes near me a nil chance which seems really unfair. And now I am stuck with no alternative, I can’t cure it. But I realized something that the reason I can’t cure it is because I am afraid of losing him in my heart. The pain became a part of me that I no longer can let go of it. It’s like the pain is what I live for and it shadows all the sense left in me. It sounds weird but now I realize it. I don’t know what’s worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? I don’t know why I instigate, And say what I don’t mean I don’t know how I got this way I know it’s not alright So, I’m breaking the habit I’m breaking the habit Tonight… The chorus, the most hard-hitting words in the song are here. Yes, I have no idea what I am fighting for, if it is the love I feel or the obsession to experience the feeling of having someone love me which I lost in him. I don’t know why I want to hurt to myself for one person who does not know me deeply. I don’t know why I keep on doing this to myself. Maybe because the feeling of regret and pain clouded my sanity to the point that I don’t know what to do with all the emotions I feel. I don’t know why I say some things that I know in my heart I don’t mean. Like when I say that I am okay when I am not, when I said that I don’t like him when I do. That’s when I realized that these feelings cannot be denied because the more I do that the harder it is for me to overcome all the pain. There is no other way that to face the worst pain I ever encountered so far and while I’m facing it, I have to let go of the source of the pain though I find myself at a certain point that its hard to break away from the habit, the habit of seeing and having mixed emotions when I see him, reality came crashing down that I just need to say adios to the habit of him… I’ll paint it on the walls Coz I’m the one at fault I’ll never fight again And this is how it ends Yes, as sang by Linkin Park at the Coda, I am the one at fault. These things would never have happened if only I had been more careful about the feelings I give to others. These things would never have occurred if only I had not fought the feelings I suppressed when he used to like me. I would never have to go through all these if only I had been more open-minded to the things that could possibly be. I would never have to stick to the feeling of pain if only I had to learn to let go of it beforehand. And most of all, I would have never written this if only I had decided to break away from him before he became someone that I would find myself hard to live without though he only causes me pain. All these could have been avoided if only I stopped myself from hurting my feelings and stopped liking and loving him completely. So, yes, it is my fault and I am trying my best to make up for that mistake. I don’t know what’s worth fighting for Or why I have to scream?? But now I have some clarity To show you what I mean I don’t know how I got this way I’ll never be alright So, I’m breaking the habit I’m breaking the habit Tonight This is the last chorus, the last few lines in the song. I am trying to break away from the habit, though it’s hard to do, I am doing my best and I hope it is good enough. I can never be TOTALLY ALRIGHT because he has inflicted serious wounds here in my heart. But I realized that I can’t exactly dwell on these feelings forever because it’s not healthy for me or the people around me. I can’t let people wait for me to be completely happy because for the longest time they had exerted effort for me to be close to him or give me chances, but I guess I and my ex-ai will never be… our fates are not intertwined with each other. But who knows? Maybe in the future we will meet again and maybe when we see each other he will no longer be a habit, but just a memory that I can live without. But I know, deep inside my heart he will always and forever be a part of me that I never can completely let go of."
doc00875,6,"Amanda Pickerell July 28, 2004 Julie Lundblad Springboard essay 1 Far From Perfect You used to see them every day. They used to be the people that everyone admired. Their son was the captain of the football team and their daughter was the cheerleading captain. Dad worked from 9 to 5 Monday through Friday, and Mom made Turkey for dinner and Apple Pie for desert. “The Perfect Family”, the family that everyone wanted to be in. We often see other people’s families in very different eye’s than we see our own. We see the Mom that makes fresh baked cookies every week. We see milk that is delivered to their door step. We see the kids with 4.0 grade point averages. We may even see the Dad coming home from work to a hot meal and a back rub by his ever devoted wife. Maybe our best friend is the Cheerleading Captain. Maybe we work with the Dad. Whatever part we have in one of the family member’s lives we still see the “Roses that grow by the door step.” But there are things that we dont see. Like when the daughter ends up pregnant at 16 or when the son is heavy into drugs or alchohol abuse. We can't see the mom being abused by her husband or the dad being laid off of work. Althought this is a worst case scenario, it is a good example of the things that we dont see because we dont want to see. also the other people dont want to have us see the imperfections in their perfect lives. They can sweep it under the carpet. As do all families. We all have things to hide. THe question here is, do you hide your problems and never solve them or do you display it for all to see. Alice Hoffman’s Essay “The Perfect Family” tells us what it was like fifty years ago, and how every family was portrayed as. “When I was growing up in the 50’s there was only one sort of family, the one we watched on television every day. Right in front of us, in black and white, was everything we needed to know about family values: the neat patch of lawn, the apple tree, the mother who never once raised her voice, the three lovely children: a Princess, a Kitten, a Bud and, always, the father who knew best.” She knew then that all of the families were not perfect. However that is how all people saw other families. WHen her parents got a divorce, their problems were not as easily hidden. She shares that “I did not meet another child of divorced parents until 10 years later when I went off the college.” It is said now that one in two marriages will end in either divorce or a legal separation. Our world is no longer seemingly perfect. We have mothers that have children out of wedlock and fathers that are alcoholics. Every day we see stories of children that do not have enough food for them to eat. We also see violence on TV, newspapers, radio, and most recently the internet. A person can find recipes for homemade bombs and other such violent weapons. Just three years ago we saw Terrorists fly loaded planes full of innocent people into the World trade Center. The interesting thing about all of these problems that we see now is that it was the same way then as it is now. There were fathers that cheated on their wives and Children starved every day. We were fighting wars then and we were shown violence then too. What made the difference then? Why did we not see all of the same problems then. IT might be because it was not ""acceptable"" then. It was seen as different or abnormal. when did it become a normal occurance for families to break apart and destroy any children in that family? The moest important question here is : Why do we see all of our problems now, and why couldnt we see them fifty years ago? THE actual truth of the matter is that we had the same problems. we saw the same things. It was not acceptable then. Even though times have changed and our standards have for some reason gone down, we also have some things that have changed for the good. Anyone that wants to can go to college and get a degree. WHites and blacks can eat in the same restureaunt, and people can fall in love an not have to worry if they are in the same social class. Instead of dwelling on the negitive things, why dont we stop and think about all of the things that we take for granted. Just take the time to stop and smell the roses."

doc00878,3,"Just spent most of the morning creeping round my flat with a fly swat, really gotta take the rubbish out more regularly in future. Got a message from JW, seems she has met someone at the summer school she is working at that she wants to set me up with for a date. Naturally the very idea of a 'date' in any form fills me with dread. I can't really envisage anything other than a disastrous outcome. I don't know what JW is thinking, her image of me is perhaps a little clouded and she is projecting qualities onto me for the sake of her little scheme. 2 plus 2 does not equal 5 however, and I don't know what the poor woman in question would end up thinking of JW for having set her up with quite such a freak as me. All this rather messes with my head since this year I have really sort of come out as a confirmed celibate, at least in my Mongolian social context. If the girl really is nice couldn't I just meet her socially rather than go through the ghastly ritualistic practice of dating which I have no experience of and am totally intimidated by? Since I consider romantic relationships impossible for me I'd be far happier just aiming for friendship, its a much safer place to start. Anyway I can't afford to wine and dine on my third world salary. Consulted EJSW in Argentina on this. She says I should 'bite the bullet'. I guess I should have expected that. Also says I'm not such an odd bloke really. I can't agree I fear. She doesn't know my interior monologues. As ever EJSW is all surface and froth, I don't think she really understands me at all.

doc00886,6,"I wonder if Frank Sinatra and Sid Vicious are together somewhere in the afterlife singing duets? They were both self-affirmed punks, after all. I took yesterday off as a vacation day - Jon and I spent most of it getting our house finally in order from the move. 3 months after the move we officially have everything out of the boxes. I spent yesterday afternoon brewing beer - now that's a hobby of mine that displays the INTP nature of becoming competent (but not mastering) at a skill. I know just enough about beer brewing to brew up a decent batch of ale but that's as far as I got. Just to bore you, Beer is composed of 4 main ingredients: water, malted barley, yeast, and hops. You also have adjuncts, which can be anything from corn syrup to jalepeno peppers. The water is self-explanatory. Barley is a type of grain - ""malted"" means it has been allowed to germinate then dried. If you chewed on some malted barley as opposed to unmalted, the malted tastes sweeter. Malted barley (and malted wheat, sometimes) is lightly crushed and allowed to steep in hot water. This is called ""mashing"" and basically it's converting the starches in the malted grain into sugar. The sugar water is drained from the leftover husks, then allowed to boil for an hour or so. During the boil, hops are added at certain intervals to counteract the sweetness and provide flavors. Trust me. Without hops beer would be so gaggingly sweet no one but desperate alcoholics would drink it. And Southerners. Have you ever drank store-bought sweet tea? About the same in sweetness. At least kool-aid has citric acid. I digress. After boiling the crap out if it, this sweet water is referred to as ""wort"". The wort is cooled, then yeast is introduced, and then it's all up to those little buggers to eat the sugar, and piss alcohol and fart CO2. Once they are done, the beer is removed from the dead yeast bed. At that point it can either be force-carbonated with CO2 (usually done if kegging), or a little more sugar can be re-introduced so that the more stubborn yeast remaining can carbonate the beer naturally (usually done if bottling). Note national breweries force-carbonate everything. I buy pre-measured kits with malt extracts. It means someone else has mashed the grain - I buy the wort, essentially. I add water, boil the crap out of it, and hop it up then add yeast. I own a freezer dedicated to beermaking / beer kegging so I set my fermenter in the freezer for temperature control while the yeast eat themselves silly. Most people don't know this, but there's only two types of beer: Ale and Lager. Ales are brewed at higher temperatures, and the yeast tend to hang around the top of the wort. They also ferment out pretty fast (5 -7 days) so are ready for drinking quicker. Lagers are fermented at lower temperatures and can take months to ferment out. Lager yeasts tend to hang around the bottom. Ales can taste sweeter; lagers taste crisper. Most popular American beers are Lagers. Everything else is style. Ale styles include the sweeter Scotch, Irish and Brown ales, and the heavily hopped Pale Ales and the dark Porters and Stouts to the light Cream ales. Lagers include the light Pilsners to the dark German Bocks. Most American beers are modelled after the Czech Pilsners. I don't dislike American Beer; I was drinking Michelob Light during my brew session last night. I'm just glad that there's more variety available, thanks not only to imports, but regional brewers like Sam Adams and Anchor. I'm addicted to Anchor Porter almost as much as I love Guinness Stout. Mmmmmmm. Styles are determined by recipe. When malt is dried, it can be roasted for a darker, richer flavor. This procedure is what gives the darker brews their color. Darker beers do not neccessarily have greater alcohol content; that is determined by how much sugar you start with and end with in the brew. American beers tend to use rice or corn which can give the beers a lighter flavor because the sugar from these grains tend to brew out more than those in barley (conversion to alcohol is more complete). You aren't going to hear me complain too loudly: you go mow the lawn then reach into your refrigerator for a Guinness! Blech. I am brewing an Irish Red Ale. It's somewhat similar to Killian's Red; except that's a lager so mine tastes a little richer. Mmmm. Right now I'm in that 24 - 48 hour period where I'm worried that I killed my yeast. If you exercise good sanitation techniques, once you introduce the yeast it should be the dominant bug in the brew so it will go forth and multiply so fast that no other bug will get a toe-hold. However if the yeast are quitters any other germ can have a field day. So far I have never had a batch of bad beer (except one bad attempt at lager. That wasn't bugs, though. It tasted like shoe. I think I let it ferment at too high a temp) due to non-yeasty bugs taking over. We shall see."

Kind blessing, his burden, a gift without peer, A so-said deliverance from sin for all time. (but didn’t Jesus himself tell us this?) People unthinking and vested in cheer Unknowing and sobbing their various tears. Nearing their ends and divining the why— Said God killed his own to rend from us fear. (This stanza has the most direction since it works with our right to reason which could also be our downfall in the end) Though easy to reason his purpose was greater— The child the nadir the gift, may we mind Descended with no greater desire nor drive (kinda prosy here) Than to live as a man, as man then to die I think your poem is still in the stages of ideas becoming something greater. It needs elaboration and the elaboration needs a vehicle. I like your last line and I know you do too. It works beautifully to conclude an argument, but I think your human reasoning is what needs some work. To me the poem needs an edge for us readers to perch and rest our reading minds. The tossing-in of the conflict seems unfulfilling. Jesus as our lowest point in humanity…..I guess my belief comes into interpretation here….I believe Jesus’ coming is one of two most high points in our humanity. But another belief and conflict comes into play here: human reason vs. God’s unerring plan. The word Nadir was a hard one to pull off. I guess my question would be is it God’s lowest point or is it ours? I would have liked it if you elaborated on our reasoning and found a way to connect your plan of Jesus (God) just wanting to live as a man. Now that’s a lotta work and I’m not so sure it can be done with the poem set in this day and age or with the fact that God is perfect, so his plan would never fail, so you have to make it seem as though it is working, but once again I am not so sure it works with Christianity. You could possibly set the poem from a Jewish perspective…just a suggestion…then you could make the poem more of a parable instead of you just kind of pointing us towards your idea or goal. I just think you need to build a better argument, since you are going up against, well let’s face it, The Word of God. Maybe to make it work better is to, as I suggested, make it a parable but also make it more comical/light-hearted. Jesus, sitting at the right hand of the Pater telling everyone in heaven via a parable what he wanted to do instead and/or the parable relates to the delusive practice of human’s of which we call reasoning. I am saying this because I feel it is necessary for me as a Christian to remind you of what you are toying around with (our salvation) and what a bunch of other minds have done too. You could bring in other writers’ perspectives within Jesus’ Last Parable. Jesus could address the Father as Pater, which in turn could be your second line because I think that, “ Our powerful, thundering, heavenly Pater,” doesn’t do so much for the Chris Man. I like the word/line “divining the way.” It reminds me of devising, so it seduces me into the error of our ways but how we mask it with hyperbolic words. This ties in with the idea of illusions. Who is actually talking? Jesus? Satan? Who is this being talking to? Us? Everyone in heaven, hell and earth? This could make a great short story. Or epic poem! ;-) I think deception give the readers that chance to decide what they want to believe, because that is, afterall, what God has given us the ability to do. I hope y suggestions help. I believe the poem would work much better being comical and also as a parable possibly being told by the deciever himself... (I say possibly because that is what we the readers will have to decide). To me it is depressing to think that we just made up Jesus intentions. Because without Him we’re in the dark forever. I’m not just saying this as a Christian, because the Bible itself, as I am sure you know refutes your poem. With that, I think you need to either work with it or against it (which I do not recommend). Working within the confinements of the Bible and using Satan as a subversive deception could give this an edge for the reader not to rest on (as stated before) but to die upon if they fail to make the right choice. Your beliefs are yours, but I just wanted to let you know how my beliefs interacted with your poem and I am sure others would too. It was hard to grab the idea that Jesus just wanted to die or live as a man without trying to save his people. That would be a worldy/selfish ideal not vested within our Lord. Maybe I need clarification on your intentions, but when I first read that last stanza of yours, Though easy to reason his purpose was greater— The child the nadir the gift, may we mind Descended with no greater desire nor drive Than to live as a man, as man then to die I wanted to agree with the fact that yes, He wanted to live as a man and then to die as a man so he could be our way to heaven, but not with the idea that he just wanted to walk amongst us for the sake of walking. Maybe that’s what you want me to do????? I just think with your vantage point it is hard to argue. We should get together and discuss this further, especially before me and Laura take off! I would love to talk about this notion you have and what can be done with it. And with what you want to do with it. Very interesting ideas Kris. You never cease to amaze me with your intellect and insight. Keep writing!"
doc00911,6,Caloy picked me up at around 7:00 PM at my Place then nagpunta kami ng cheers(again) para magtanong ng Lechon De-Leche. Dahil sa lahat ng mga bars at resto dito sa Abu Dhabi Cheers lang ang me Lechon De-Leche but you have to order 4 days prior.

We have to leave early also because tomorrow morning I will be on site and the driver will pick me up at around 7:00 AM.

Dahil medyo mahal kasi sa mga bars dito unlike when I was in the Phil. na everyday eh gumigimik kami.
doc00912,3,I am all pumped up to see Matrix: Revolutions tomorrow. So I decided to start reading online reviews. Not a good idea. The critics are tearing it apart. But still I know I will enjoy it. The plan is to meet and eat bbq and then hit the movie. After the movie hopefully there will be a lot of drinking involved. I guess I really don't have a whole lot to say. I chilled out downtown a tonight. Nothing special just got some food and sat in Seattle's for a bit. Oh I did get a winter hat that I will be able to pull over my eyes so I won't be waking up at the ass crack of dawn all the time. I've still got to go to immigration at some point. No doubt Scott has forgotten. I should call him or something. I don't want to find out what happens if I don't get my card within 90 days. Granted I do have a fair amount of time until then but best to get it out of the way. Ok that's it.
doc00913,5,"The tide is high and I'm holding on, I'm gonna be your number one. I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that.. Ooooooh noooo. -Atomic Kitten, ""The Tide is High"" Woot woot! it's my b-day month! July was insane, and it all started where June left off. On July second I was outside tanning cause i wanted to look good. the thought of Dominic being gay made me realize there are probably a lot of other gay guys in Santa Cruz too. so i tanned. and then i fell alseep. and 2 hours later i woke up burned. my whole front side was red. ouch. i took a shower and put some aloe on it... but it didnt really help. on the fourth I went with Ili to wilder ranch. i pathetically hoped that she'd invite dominic but she didnt. that little runt. jk!!~ wilder was a lotta fun... except i was burned... and the ice cream melted... but i had my stars and stripes boxers on!! mm yeah. then, when i got back home, my grandparents came over and we had pie and stuff. oo! and the fireworks were soooo cool! my dog like wet himself, but he does that every year. the next day jamie, maya and kristen came over. have i mentioned maya before? maya's a really smart and really cool person from shoreline. i've known her since the end of sixth grade when we had drama together. shes lots of laughs and shes really smart. her bat mitzvah was soo much fun! ok~ yeah.. jamie and maya and kristen came over and we watched buffy. :-D! The Hush episode was really scary and my burn was really itching. ooh yeah, and jamie broke her leg and she had to go to the ER room on the second (the same day i got my burn!). anyway, that was fun and then it was over.. so the next day i went to see Legally Blonde 2 with Kalie, Amanda and Bobbi. Amanda is adorable! shes funny and cute and no guy can resist that. bobbi's lots of fun too and shes a good advice-giver. anyway, the movie was really good and outside the theater we saw Jake Scruggs, Emily Hasty and CHRIS HASTINGS. coincidence or what! oo i really liked that guy from the movie and i thought he was gay the whooole time.. but then he asked that girl to marry him and it was like ""bummer..."" that night all i could talk or even think about was chris. i was talking to gina and she IMed me dominic's screenname. and he wa son. so we talked for 2 hours and somehow chris left my mind. i didnt even think about him again until mid august. dominic was nice and really sweet... it didnt take long for me to fall for him. but i fall for everyone so thats not saying much. on the 8th we were going out and we talked on the phone for 6 and a half hours! my all time record.. at least until november. :-D. and by the 13th we had our first date. we saw pirates of the carribean and yeah.. it was fun.. :-D! overall dominic's a great guy.. or at least he was at first. but then things started getting shitty and yeah. it ended. THAT COOLEST THING is that ym's horoscope guide said that i would fall for a pisces and it said the 8th and 13th were lucky days, but the 22nd was a bad one. and i broke up with him on the 22nd. freaky. the week of my birthday was crazy. i went shopping a lot. jocelyn and i got kicked outta abercrombie for modelling and hara fell in love with cheyenne. kathleen and kalie and i had a lotta fun trying clothes on at anchor blue OH! Kathleen! she's bundles of fun, and she was my best friend last year. for her b-day i got her 20o bucks worth of stuff including DVDs, CDs and 100 balloons! ellen got me a shirt from American Eagle and i PROMISED to wear it the first day of school. but before that i wore it on my brithday when nathalie and I saw how to deal. that was such a good movie. outside the theater we saw this old guy selling brownies and we said there was prolly pot in them. lol. july was an awesome month, and the perfect end to the perfect story was my brand new cell phone. woot woot. yup yup ~Brandon"
doc00914,2,"In trying to figure out what to write for a first entry in a new journal I thought about metaphors relating to such ideas as ""an empty book waiting to be filled"", ""a blank page ready to be laden with words,"" and so forth. Years ago I kept a daily journal -- you know, the good old pen and paper kind. The kind with no ""backspace"" key, except for the pink rubber kind that came standard on most No. 2 pencils -- I always used a medium point ball pen -- and no ""undo"" function, aside from being able to just rip the page out of the book -- something that I refused to do. I figured if I wrote it, then it belongs there so I never erased and as far as I can remember never ripped out a page. When starting a new journal I usually bought a spiral notebook with just about 250 pages in it. I preferred the ones with yellow paper as I usually found them easier on the eyes especially late at night sitting, talking and writing with my friends at Ike's Great American. I also found the 250-page size easy to handle and carry as it went practically anywhere I did ready to capture the thought of the moment. This digital journal is certainly quite different in so many respects. I cannot doodle in it like I could my old pen and paper journal. I suppose if I must doodle I could do that on a separate piece of paper, scan it then upload it to an entry. But that certainly takes away from the function and the very art of the doodle I think. It's also somewhat different in that my mood would often affect my handwriting. Even today I can look at an old journal and imagine my mood at the time just by the pressure and size of my writing and even by whether or not I wrote cursive or printed. I know that the Livejournal allows you to use different typestyles, sizes and weight which is good, but writing with a pen is a much more emotional and organic process than adding an html bold tag to the beginning and ending of a particularly strong word. I accept that as a challenge, however, not as a pitfall. I suppose the biggest difference is that my pen and paper journal existed mostly for myself to read. Yes, at times I allowed certain people to read bits and pieces for different reasons, but Livejournal, though it has a ""private journal"" function, is by design and by its very presence on the World Wide Web something meant for the whole world to see. That is not necessarily a bad thing -- it's just a difference between the old way and this way. My journal entries then ranged from random thoughts to childhood anectodes to poems and musings. An entry ranged from a single word if I felt so inclined to pages. I never edited anything in my journal. Usually I would just start writing until I said everything I felt like saying. I used good grammar. I used bad grammar. I used full sentences with thoughtful transitions and I used fragments. Whatever I thought -- I wrote. If I wrote something that I thought merited revision I would usually copy it as a separate story or essay, but always left the original form intact in my journal. I will certainly use this journal the same way. And I will try to never edit anything, though the mouse and backspace key are certainly easy to use when I'm so inclined to change a thought. But generally I'll just type what I think and feel. Perhaps I'll even go back to some of my old pen and paper journals and reprint some of my old entries for all the world to enjoy. Hopefully someone out there will find this and start reading along. Maybe I'll make some new friends doing it. Maybe no one but me will ever lay eyes on what I have to say. But at least I'll say it and I hope that doing so will be as therapeutic and inspiring for me now as it was back in the pen and paper days of the 80s."

I liked how Deb Sullivan called her garden her friend and how she compared the twin nephews and the garden on how they were the same.

doc00921,1,"As you can see from this picture, the camping trip was no washout. A little thunder, a lot of insect bites, a spot of walking, plenty of good company and verdant countryside. On Saturday we ate lunch on a rocky outcrop overlooking the simply-named Lake #4. Left to right: Amie, Laura, me. Behind the camera: Courtney. I have decided the Adirondacks are NY's Lake District. Many of their attributes compare favourably, save the names. Lakes #1-6 are no match for the likes of Derwent Water, Grasmere and Windermere. Can you imagine Wordsworth writing a poem titled &quot;Lines Left on a Tree Stump Overlooking Lake #4,&quot; or &quot;For The Spot Where The Hermitage Stood on Island #6, Lake #2?&quot; There is no prize for identifying the Wordsworth poem I culled the title for this post from, but have a go anyway.

doc00925,3,"I've been confused for many ethnicities and national origins. You name it, I've been called it. From Pakistani to Native American to French, I'm never amazed anymore by what people think I ""am."" But here is one of the weirdest stories: I used to work at Grady Hospital. If you know the area, you know that homeless and poor folk hang around there. It's routine to be panhandled on your way to work or to your car. You learn to be polite, whether you give anyone change or not. Well, one night, a black man approached me. He appeared to be the average panhandler. Let me also add that he didn't appear immediately to look Latino or Caribbean; he seemed to be a normal black American. But when he asked me for change, he did so in Spanish. Let me repeat - he panhandled me in Spanish. He must have sized me up as he approached me. It took a lot of savvy to plot out different panhandling strategies, and to appeal to each person in a particularly sensitive way. Except, he blew it with me. He would have been better off asking in English. I've never been the sort to dodge something with language. I wish I could pretend to not speak English in order to confuse or hide from someone. ""I so sorry. Me no speakee Engleesh."" But I can't. And I haven't. More often than not, I've served as an interpreter for others, like my mom. Especially as children, we look up to adults to take on the role of interacting with society. But my brother and I were always the ones to fill out the school forms and handle conferences with teachers. So I've never had the opportunity to take ""proper"" English for granted. It was a learned survival strategy. A good example of this stands out in my mind. My mom has always had difficulty with our various next door neighbors. Where they live now is no exception. The little white kids that live there would literally terrorize my mom - stealing bags of dog food from our carport, throwing eggs on our car, spitting in the mail box. One day she decided to go talk to their mother. I went over with her, reluctantly, my face probably 9 shades of red. Despite my presence, my mom decided to do most of the talking, and most of it was in angry Korean. Let me just say that the discussion did not go well. The cross-eyed blonde lady next door thought her kids were just angels. Little angels. As we were walking home, my mom was still fuming. I told her the lady didn't understand what my mother was saying. My mother insisted, in Korean, ""How can she not understand?"" So even though the guy panhandled me in Spanish, maybe the point is not his misidentification of me. Maybe the point is that I actually do know enough Spanish and about human communication to understand what he meant. As a post script, I was telling this story to Rahim and his response to my list of mistaken racial identities was: ""It's because you're so pretty."" No wonder I love him."
doc00926,2,"I just remembered that when I was little, I had a book about grammar. Well, not really about grammar, I guess. I think it was kind of, like, secretly about grammar. It was grammar on the down low. Like you know how children's books appear to be about one thing to children, but adults can see the book is really about something else entirely? So, when I was little, the book appeared to be about (my memories of this are very fuzzy) some guy walking around a factory where sentences were made, and something malfunctioned so all the sentence parts were messed up. The one thing I remember most is that there were ""dangling modifiers,"" like they were actually dangling off scaffolding or something. Anyway, now I can see that the book was really trying to teach me grammar. I guess it worked, seeing as how my job's all about the grammar. But isn't that weird? I really liked this book about sentence structure, and then like 20 years later I'm a copy editor. Weird. You know, books seemed so much more interesting when I was a little kid. When reading was still all new and exciting. Now reading is old and boring. Like urlLink Congress . I learned to read when I was 3. According to my parents, one day I was sitting on the floor with a urlLink TV Guide , babbling, which I guess I did a lot, because they just ignored me. Then after a while they started listening to the babble and realized I was actually reading the TV Guide aloud. So I guess that means my first favorite book was the TV Guide. That figures, huh? Because I watch all kinds of TV. This got me to thinking about other books I really liked when I was little. There are a few books I remember carrying around and reading all the time whose titles and subject matter I cannot recall for the life of me. I had one book that was yellow and had something to do with urlLink Art Linkletter . I'm not even really sure who Art Linkletter is, but I remember his name from this book. I had another book that I think was one of those ""random facts"" type of books, but the only ""random facts"" I remember is that it talked about how you could kill werewolves with silver bullets and vampires with wooden stakes. I only remember this because it scared me. There are a couple of books whose titles I do remember ... but the title's just about all I can remember. Septimus Bean and his Amazing Machine: I remember nothing about this book except for the cartoony illustrations of medievally dressed characters, which I think about every time I go to the urlLink Round Table in A.G. and sit at the booth with posters of similarly drawn pizza-loving knights and maidens on the wall. For the longest time (that is, until just now, when I did a Google search) I thought the name of the book was ""Septimus Bean and his Flying Machine,"" so that probably means Septimus Bean's machine is so amazing because it flies. Or maybe it cooks pizza. urlLink The Very Hungry Caterpillar : My cousins had this book, so I got to look at it whenever we went to their house. I remember thinking it was the greatest book ever when I was little, but I looked it over at Barnes & Noble recently and was not impressed. I suppose my standards for interactive entertainment have raised considerably since I was 4. Bagdad Ate It : I used to check out this book from my elementary school's library all the time so I could bring it home and read it to Tommy when he was a baby. From what I remember, it was about a little puppy that grew into a big hungry dog that ate everything, including, if I recall correctly, a brown paper bag, and that's how he got his name. But that last part might not be true. That might be just how, as a child, I imagined he got his name, and over the years my mind distorted the imaginary hypothesis into the truth. You know how that goes. urlLink Bread and Jam for Frances : Again, I don't actually remember anything about the plot of this book. What I remember are the pictures of urlLink bread with jam on it and eggs in little cups . A 32-page book, and all I remember is the food. So I was just reading about the book on Amazon.com, and it seems to be about Frances being picky and only wanting to eat bread and jam, so that's all her mom gives her, until she gets sick and tired of bread and jam and decides she wants to eat what everyone else is eating. Now I can see why I really liked this book when I was little: Frances' mom was nice. My mom would have NEVER let me eat bread and jam all the time. If we were eating dinner, and I had recited some kind of cute little poem about how I don't like what we were having for dinner, and then asked for bread and jam, my mom would have yelled ""EAT YOUR FUCKING DINNER!"" so loudly that people the next block over would have been frantically stuffing food in their mouths and whimpering. My mom was a dinner nazi. I remember sitting at the kitchen table, alone, in the dark, staring at a pile of canned beets left on my plate, while the rest of the family watched TV just a few feet away, for what seemed like hours, until my mom finally gave up and sent me to my room. To this day, I do not eat beets. So anyway, I haven't seen any of those books in years. I do, however, run into the TV Guide from time to time. I don't read it, though. That's what Channel 6 is for."
doc00927,4,"I guess if God gives each person her cross to bear in life, mine would be the seems-simple-but-really-isn't act of trying to get my instinct to trump my anxiety. Every time. I was never a natural mother. Or at least I convinced myself I wasn't. From even before the sperm hit the egg, I understood on about 85 levels the daunting task before me. It still daunts me, every day. And my kid can't be in the same room as a peanut, so it's like daunt-on-steroids with every breath. Living the unexamined life has never been my forte. After&nbsp;P was born and they stripped the sheets off my hospital bed while I was still gushing blood every time I cleared my throat and sent us back to our first Rowhouse, I was truly amazed that without any effort at all except a good diet and regular medical care (and some supplemental hardcore hormone drugs), some unseen force of greatness had given me a person with one head, ten each toes and fingers, a heart that beat, lungs that breathed, little black-cherries for eyes and even hair! At the end, on my scans just before her birth, there is her crazy hair like the tendrils of moon jellies in the womb. Her hair is really long now, and curly. It goes all the way down to her butt. And she wears little glasses -- she looks every inch the studious, poindextery, lizard-and-bug loving little daughter of a physics-major father that she is. But back to the early days. When your milk comes&nbsp;in on day three or four,&nbsp;a flood of emotion comes with it. It is inexplicable. I felt pretty good&nbsp;during my pregnancy -- in contrast to my typical Eeyore self -- preoccupied, but pumped. I actually loved being pregnant --&nbsp; I wasn't sick -- and it agreed with me. I was a cute pregnant person with great skin -- rather like a weebul with a Campbell-Soup-Kid head and expression. The whole thing rocked: no exercise, all-you-can-eat and everything tasting awesome, and the&nbsp;doting attentions of an adoring man.&nbsp; Friends tell me this changes in subsequent pregnancies&nbsp;but I haven't had the chance to test this theory. Your first pregnancy, he'll run out and buy you sweet peppers in the middle of the night in the rain, but the second pregnancy and beyond, he expects you to move all the furniture in the living room and vacuum without his view of the game on TV being blocked even once. So&nbsp;there I was, with a three-day-old, wailing, nonsleeping P, and with nothing tasting good to me anymore but Lucky Charms and caffeine free Pepsi,&nbsp;bawling my eyes out at the little expression on P's face that wondered, ""Is this lady up to the job?"" I know it's insane. I guess I proved that I was. Although I don't have a mom, and I don't have a sister, so daily conversations with ALa71 really saved me and absolutely nothing else did. It's not like there was a support&nbsp;wagon out front telling me to put my feet up while they took care of the baby. When S wasn't home, I was completely on my own. I watched a lot of Woody Allen movies at the beginning with a sleeping baby on my lap. And&nbsp;I figured out mothering day by day. Then the time came for her to learn to eat. I come from a really allergic family, so I did what the American Academy of Pediatrics said and breastfed and gave nothing else for the first six months. The first day we tried cereal, she made faces but ate it. And so it went with the baby foods -- sweet potatoes, squash, oatmeal, applesauce and so on. The first foods. The least allergenic ones. Then she stopped. Yes, my daughter stopped eating entirely at about age 10 months. At first I didn't worry too much -- or else I consoled myself with the platitudes that prevent you from dying of panic. Pickiness, some said. Give her a hot dog! She'll eat that. The doctor and everyone else I asked said, ""Well, give her time; she can still nurse to sustain her caloric needs, you don't really need to worry about it until after she's one."" She turned one. She still wouldn't eat. Not only wouldn't she eat -- she would cry about it. Really cry. And scream. If you went near her with food she would freak out as if you were offering her a hot poker. I called the doctor again. And again. He said, finally: Make an appointment for her at the feeding clinic at Best Kid's Hospital in the Country. They'll get it sorted out and make you feel better about what you're doing. Best Kid's has a waiting list a mile long to get a splinter evaluated, much less a developmental delay. I made the appointment -- I filled out their ridiculous Great American Novel of paperwork -- and&nbsp;we went, jazzed to the nines, terrified of what they'd say. Because now she was thirteen months old. The nursing was doing her okay -- she wasn't ill -- but she was thin. Not gaining. Not growing. Not good. My baby, a plump, rosy, juicy&nbsp;75th percentile for weight until age 10 months -- now 5th percentile. She just was not getting enough calories -- human milk is not complete nutrition, calorically speaking, after age one. Still 95th for height -- which she has maintained her whole life. She's tall, like her dad. Up until the appointment, I'd tried everything. This is how we learned about the food allergies. Sometimes, the stuff I'd encourage her to eat gave her hives all over her face when she spit it out. Back then, it was one more thing to vault me straight through to holy terror, but in retrospect I think it was a mercy. If she'd been ""normal,"" and I'd been ""peanut butter,"" things could've turned really ugly. Luckily we had this giant monkey wrench in the works, so Trying New Things became not just secondary, but so far at the bottom of the list as to be almost insignificant. And lucky for us, because her food allergies are fierce. Nothing to&nbsp;mess around with on any day. Three epi-pens with her at all times. Complete caution in every situation for both premise and ingestion. Back at the Best Kids Feeding Clinic,&nbsp;they were&nbsp;not operating with a full deck. They seemed to have one treatment protocol that they applied to every situation. The first time, a bunch of chatty ladies barged into the exam room (where tiny, skinny&nbsp;P with tear-filled eyes was wearing a little blue flannel gown with a dog on it that said ""Perfect Patient"") carrying a tray of stuff she could not eat.&nbsp;Underlying medical conditions were not even mentioned until a month later, and then a medication was prescribed that tasted so bad I couldn't even make her take it with the strong immature tongue-thrust reflex she still had. Feeding tubes were bandied about; I was told I had a negative attitude and she needed hospitalization because I was&nbsp; clearly too stressed out by the whole thing to manage it properly. But, I was told, there was a five-month waiting list for the hospitalization program and intensive eating occupational therapy -- maybe more. Did I want her to be on the list? My skinny P, nursing all day long, only losing a half a pound, but not eating, not eating. I did put her on the list -- I didn't know what else to do. They recommended referral to this and that specialist there at the hospital. Each one, the usual long wait, the usual Book of Info to be filled out, the usual warehousing and one-size fits all. Well, it didn't fit me, on the most instinctive level, that's for sure. So after all the demoralization and eddying around&nbsp;in the backwaters of Whether I&nbsp;Was Actually&nbsp;a Good&nbsp;Mother,&nbsp;I found some of my old&nbsp;pluck and told them off, with my little sick baby there playing with Winnie the Pooh blocks. I told them where to stick their feeding tube -- I suspected a milk allergy even then and I didn't feel there was a formula in the world she could've taken that would not have made her anaphylax. I told them where to stick their negative attitude and their plate of bullshit she couldn't even eat. And I left, not sure if we'd ever go back. They were utterly useless. We didn't go back. Instead, we got a miracle. S asked his boss World Renowned Surgeon about a GI referral -- clearly there was something more going on with our little P that Kids Best planned to string us through a hundred month-intervals to pad their pockets in order to discover. There wasn't time, though, so it was on a summer day with my dad in tow that I went to see Dr. Irish. Dr. Irish is a big, wonderful man with a soft voice that I wanted to secretly tape so that I could listen to it in moments of doubt.&nbsp; He also had extensive experience doing studies on food-allergic kids at Feeding Clinic in Another State, so I knew he came well-recommended. He looked at my little P, tousled her curls and said, ""Look at her, she's perfect."" I started to cry. ""But when will she eat ?"" ""Not for a while yet,"" Dr. Irish said. Dr. Irish wrote me a scrip for a better-tasting reflux drug that Kids Best had told me was ""impossible to obtain."" My pharmacy filled it that afternoon. P gained two pounds in two weeks on my milk alone. Dr. Irish also recommended that we see a doctor in his office -- now in private practice -- whose life's work was teaching children to eat. And so began our fourteen months of Occupational Therapy with Dr. Wonderful. ""What were they talking, feeding tube?"" Dr. Wonderful wanted to know. ""Her stomach holds what it holds until the reflux and pooping issues are fixed. Doesn't matter where it comes from."" Once at week at first, then every two weeks, then every month -- teaching P to eat spoon by spoon and bite by bite. She finally chewed when she turned 2. She just had the Holy Grail of Mature Chewing about four months ago this year -- a raw carrot -- over a year and a half after she graduated from Feeding Clinic with Dr. Wonderful. P and Dr. Wonderful were not fast friends. Because P is a pistol, there was a time, for example, when P was not happy about Dr. Wonderful's vigilance, as she sat there in her highchair, buckled in. P made herself gag, and threw up gallons of avocado and baby food all over the clinic floor -- when she'd only eaten several ounces! There was Mommy and Dr. Wonderful cleaning P's puke with wet paper towels, with Dr. Wonderful commenting, ""Well, at least we know the acid medicine is working -- it doesn't smell too bad!"" P gave Dr. Wonderful a Swiffer wet mop for Christmas in apology for the stunt. Our little P is still being treated for reflux -- she takes Prilosec, the other purple pill, twice a day, as pellets in applesauce -- under the supervision of Dr. Irish. Dr. Wonderful went on to run a feeding clinic in another state-- God saw to it that when we needed her, there she was, in private practice right here in PA. Kids Best called in January of the following year, by the way, six months after I put P on the list. I was thrilled to no end to be able to say, ""No thanks, give the slot to another kid, because P eats.""&nbsp; Nonplussed, they asked how such a miracle occurred, and I replied simply, ""Dr. Wonderful."" They knew her, of course -- she is the finest neurodevelopmental pediatrician for feeding disorders in the whole goddamned country. Her weight is back at 50th percentile, right on target for her age, and she's as tall as a six-year-old. People think she's older than she really is. And so when we go to the zoo now -- which we're thinking about doing this afternoon, which is what got me started on this -- I look around at all the Mackenziekennakyliecodysavannahaidans everywhere, chowing down on their cheese puffs and their apple slices, and I think, no, no, no ! Look at my P, look at my P! She eats! She eats. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"

Then using seward rocks we were finding the anagrams of it. LOL. 2) Probably English with that lady teacher I have. Its boring. We all fall asleep. 3) Free periods.

It could have been the pain, though. I have a friend whose sister just got into a car wreck. She had a head on collision with another car, and she was high. Plus the police found drugs in her car. I wish drugs were legal, but they're *not*; and they are a stupid, stupid way or ruining your life. I'm not talking about addiction, I'm talking about legality. I hope the other driver pulls through; otherwise we're looking at vehicular homicide. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Happy belated birthday to Nancy. Hope the kid settles down soon.

I'm finally in a group that is like me in drive and personality so that is very important. We know how to have a good time and there is really never a dull moment. Something cool is always happening. I have actually given my bass a name. For years i have toyed with the idea, but I never really did anything about it. Now since Mike has a name for every one of his drums I just had to give my bass a name. ""Vince Clortho Lecutis"" is the name. If you can tell me in the message board how I got the name you will get 20 cool points!!! So look for me with “Vince Clortho Lecutis” the bass on the local scene with Third Rail!!

There is also some random stereotypical Korean guy with bleached hair. I try to not notice him because I don't want to admit I'm attracted to him.

And if you watch the bus can video it looks like I was beating him up also. One little kid on the bus is such a jerk. He sits ahead of me, and all the way home, he throws things at you, beats on the seat, whacks you on the head, and beats up his sister. And today it was the end of it. He whacked me on the head with a roll of paper, so I grabbed it and through it to his sister, Video View: 'I took the kids papers, taunting him, and gave them to his sister so that he would go after her.' Then I was sick of him whacking his sweater up and over the seat at me, trying to get me annoyed, so I yanked them out of his hand and told him to stop while leaning over the seat. Video View 'I ripped them out of the hands of an innocent little boy and then yelled at him over the seat and threw it at his head.' And then, he was flinging seatbelts at me from over the top. I jumped up and tried to look intimidating, (Works rather well sometimes, I'm huge when I want to be), and then I reached down and tickled him because he was in a ball. Three seconds later, he screams in pain and begins crying. He jolted when I tickled him and whacked his head on the window edge, probably did hurt like heck.

And all my teachers, sinagadsagad ang oras!! Up to the last minute, they were overloading us students with terms, definitions, formulas, and problems.. by afternoon, I was not in the mood for critical thinking anymore.

""Here's the trick.. now try this.."" every now and then really ticked me off. Usually, him saying that would amuse me.. but I was just so tired!

I acquired about 4.5 hours of sleep and nomrally that would be enough for me, but I think I used up most of my nine lives during my 5 year multi-major battle. With the shower running, I was sitting on the edge of the toilet with my head in my hands flat out exhausted. I felt like a shell, barely half there.

Maybe I should stop sleeping in the cripser drawer of the fridge. I've been trying to get myself to work on song-writing for about 30 minutes a day. I can write music no problem, I've got hours and hours of music I've written on acoustic and electric guitar. I am having a hard time writing song lyrics though. This is ironically humorous to me since I write prose all the time and have gone to several open mics in Cambridge to read what I've written. It all starts to unravel when I try to put any sort of melody behind what I write since I seem to have a subsonic vocal range and have a lot of work to do to stretch that range out. I've reached a point where it doesn't matter much, I just need to do it and refine it. And refine that. Then refine what's been finely refined. I definitely have enough material, I just need to close in on some concepts. This should be good. To finish this evening. I'm pissed. Pissed for being pissed.

This time, unlike last time, the tire went flat and I thought I had really screwed the rim up bad. It more or less put a damper on our weekend because we had to wait until today to go get it fixed and we had plans to go driving in the mountains to see the leaves change. This morning, really frickin' early, I went to Firestone, where I had it fixed last time.

That period of sitting it out and waiting for the next big project eats at me. Sometimes, it even plunges me into immobility and that uncomfortable state of creative oblivion .

doc00962,1,"urlLink margaret cho looked so hot last night. she wore this icecapades-like outfit that was brilliant, sparkling white. she looked so happy. this is her third touring comedy show, and i was happy to be seeing it. i've seen all of them live, starting from ""i'm the one that i want"" to ""notorious c.h.o."" and now to ""revolution cho."" her act has gotten considerably more political and socially conscious, which explains the show name. she talks about social inequalities, racism, crazy recent political events (aka gov. arnold). she focuses less on the gory sexual details, which was prevalent in ""notorious,"" and more on how we all can start a revolution by recognizing the silly, ""sacred"" traditions we all have come to accept as normal. marriage does not have to be sacred between just a man and woman. the government shouldn't have to ask you to die for your country, but tell you not to talk about being gay. and my favorite is when people ask you what kind of asian you are (""i can't tell any of you apart!""). marg cho: ""uh, why do you have to tell us apart? are we going to be separated and put in internment camps?"" i couldn't stop laughing when she said that. it's so true! why DO people have to tell us apart? not even we can tell us apart! she had so many new jokes and interesting perspectives to add to ""revolution,"" which made me happy because a lot of the material in her first two shows overlapped. ""revolution"" was packed with lots of new material that talks about her more current life experiences, and it's good to see that she's living in the past less and less and enjoying her present more and more. go, margaret cho ! her opening act, bruce daniels, was pretty funny too. he talked a lot about the same types of issues -- racism, social inequalities, stereotypes... marg and bruce and some other chick (can't remember her name) did a rap at the end that wasn't very good, but i had to give her props on her effort. mc mc!"

doc00968,2,"Well, this was an interesting weekend. Detroit is now up on LA 3-1, to all you Laker fans, just learn to deal with defeat graciously. If LA spent more time passing the ball, selecting their shots correctly, etc. they would be winning, instead of losing. Helped Jay move in to his new place-with the rain and the angles of him being on the second floor, that was a pain in the ass, but it really didn't take us that long. Saturday night was crazy with Tip and Steve-O trading off on Irish Carbombs-5 a piece, it got real messy real quick and I was glad I was sober to try to control it with the help of Church and Graham. Sunday, woke up to hear the phone ring and my Dad telling me that my parents were going to stop by and visit. Talk about hauling ass. They showed up 45 minutes later and I had everything spic and span. Not that the pad was that messy, but had to make sure the living room got picked up. Raul was cool enough to have people over for food and movies. Thanks again, it was a good time, but the hang over from the Ether was a bitch-lol Monday kicked ass. Hung some stuff up, bought some new stuff with some gift certificates, and showed up to Trivia where we placed 1st, for the 3rd week in a row. I love getting a free meal on Mondays. Church, Graham, Steve, and myself, rallied from a crappy first round. Had to be the worst 1st round our team has had in over a month, but we still managed to be in 3rd. We got most of the bonus questions right and stuck to the wager wisely strategy that has gotten us a top 2 finish for the last 6 weeks. Tonight, the gym and seeing if Detroit can wrap the NBA season up with a win in Detroit. For the record, Jimmy Kimmel is right, they would have a riot in Detroit if they win.

doc00971,4,"Date 5/16/04 MORNING TO 12 NOON H woke up @ 8AM and quietly turned on the TV. He was in a good mood. We visited the Animal Shelter (url: http://www.nashelter.org) H indicated that he would like to volunteer. He was eager to help out, and even picked up a mop and helped mop the floor! After that we walked one of the dogs, Danny. The visit was cut short because the Animal Control Officer had to go out on a call, but we agreed to go back in 2 weeks and visit/volunteer again. AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We walked at a local nature trail/fish hatchery. H was upset because we forgot the bug spray, but walked the nature trail anyway. H was very worried about Jack getting “loaded with ticks”, but I told him Jack gets special meds to stop ticks from getting on him. (url: http://www.fws.gov/r5cneafp/nattleboro.htm) After our walk it rained so the rest of the afternoon was spent watching movies. He was unhappy to learn the parental controls on the TV block pg13 movies, he spent some time trying (unsuccessfully) to figure out how unlock the code. I told him PG13 movies have to be evaluated individually for content. He argued that he was old enough to watch PG13 movies; I reiterated 11 is not old enough for a movie rated for a 13 year old without supervision. EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM While packing to leave H jumped up on the top bunk and broke one of the slats on the bed. He prefers to sleep on the top bunk and argued when told he’d have to use the bottom bunk until we get the top bunk fixed. He insisted that he can’t sleep on the bottom bunk, and how horrible it is. He refused to accept that he should not sleep on the bunk with a broken slat. Next weekend we will work on ways to fix the bed, and reasons why it isn’t appropriate to jump on the bed (i.e. safety, appropriate behavior, respect for property) Summary: H has a very positive attitude, and is always eager to help. He can be stubborn at times, but usually listens to reasonable explanations. He participates in all planned activities, and enjoys making future plans. He is asking to spend more time here, and has asked about coming over on Friday nights, and spending more time on school holidays."

doc00974,3,"When I was like 16 and had nothing to do on New Year's Eve, my mom once told me that New Year's Eve is the ""most overrated holiday of the year."" Statement has some creedence, even if it was only said to ease the depressing heaves of sighing from an adolescent. New Year's Eve is a bitch - you spend a lot of time planning to do something, you spend way too much money, and you're usually unfulfilled in the end result. Shameful. But then take a look at July 4th - it's a cool holiday in that it celebrates our liberation from an oppressive tyrant (insert ironic lightbulb moment here), but at the same time, it's overrated in its own sense. The thing is... your actions on July 4th mirror your development as a human being. What the hell am I talking about, you ask? Consider it: when you're younger, you spend 4th frolicing with family, extended family, and neighborhood friends. Norman Rockwell would bust a nut over it. Then, you approach college years, and you spend 4th getting pretty drunk and eating undercooked hamburgers thrown together by a guy wearing college mesh shorts (maybe that's just me). You get older, and you spend it at the pool of your apartment complex. Even though I'm making no sense right now, let's just leave it at this: 4th of July can be pretty overrated as well. CNN is interviewing Vanessa Kerry and trying to pump her for information on who the VP will be. Better question: when your father invokes the word ""values"" every 48 seconds in speeches, what exactly does he mean? I think golf is actually more interesting to watch on television than tennis. Spider Man 2 gives hopes for a new generation of nerd filmmakers obsessed with comic book tales, even though Sam Raimi is by no means a nerd. I mean, can't we have more comic book megamovies that explore the soul of the superhero's alter-ego, ala Spider Man 2? I don't think ""Hellboy"" or the shitty 1991 Captain America movie really did that. I think someone needs to make a Silver Surfer movie, and really get to the core of what makes Silver Surfer tick as a human being and a fighter of evil. I also liked Captain America back in the day; if I ever became famous, I'd write a script for a new C-America movie. Question of the Day Are there any attractive male rappers?"

doc00976,2,"Hi there, it's been a while... Heheh, I almost forgot that I have a blog here for a second, I guess it's time to wipe off the cobwebs of this poor, neglected web diary of mine... Ok, first, a quick update, right after I handed in my Group Project, we got started on a new lesson module, which is Special Effects. In case you are not aware, in my college, Lesson Modules = Lots of Free Time, coz we only have three lessons a week, accompanied by two workshop days, which we normally use to do our own shit or play games, unless there are assignments. Project time is when we get really busy. So the first week of the Special Effects module was kinda like a holiday for me (even though I still had lessons), so I chilled out for that week and didn't spend too much time with my computer. I wanted to go ice skating at Macquarie with husky9, but somehow that plan fell through, but we managed to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Heheh, that was quite funny, coz it's already been playing in the cinemas for ages, so there were only five people in the cinema, which was kinda cool, like having a private screening. I'm glad I managed to catch it in the theatres though, coz it is an excellent movie, I'll probably talk more about it in one of my 'Dumbass Movie Reviews'. I was also reading up a lot about how to create and set up your own comic book (mostly from the eatpoo forums) coz I'm planning to post up a sequential online comic, which is oh so trendy rite now. It's gonna be in the style of the 'Love and Rockets' comics by Jaime Hernandez; straight monochrome black and white inks without fancy colour effects (coz I don't know how to do that crap). I've also decided to rehaul the look of my blog, after husky9 told me about all these new templates that they've provided. Ok, as if normal html wasn't already too hard for a web moron like me, these new templates are in fuckin' xhtml... So it took me quite a while (with lots of help from husky9) to figure out how to customize the templates. Well, this is as much as I can do I guess. I may probably insert a small flash animation in the bottom right corner if I have the time, it looks a bit empty right now. (I really should think about putting in a language warning somewhere too, coz u know how I am...). My site meter's gone awol too, coz I forgot my userid, so I'll just have to wait for them to e-mail me one of their reports.

doc00977,1,"urlLink American Civil Liberties Union : USA PATRIOT Act I've been sitting on this webpage for a few days and decided I was going to post it. After reading it, it all became clear about what the USA PATRIOT Act is and what it does. I urge everyone to read this page and become familiar with the USA PATRIOT Act and understand that the government can get into your personal and private information and NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU A DAMN THING ABOUT DOING IT. Medical records, school records, criminal records, anything about you that is in a computer database or otherwise on record somewhere is now accessible for the government to sift through and there ain't a damn thing you can do to stop it. You can be jailed and incarcerated without DUE PROCESS OF LAW, which is a urlLink CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARDED PROVISION BY THE 14TH AMENDMENT . Provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act (USPA) also allow surveillance without court order. Why? Why would the government exercise this kind of invasion of privacy? They will tell you that it is for security reasons. They want to stop potential terrorists (God, I hate the usage of that word in post-9/11 America.) from doing something they haven't done yet. On the very surface, this would seem like a justified reason for having such an Act in place. However, little to people know that this Act was passed though Congress without as much as a single debate. This is because virtually no one in Congress had read the bill before its emergency overnight passage and publication. Who are we or anybody else to judge people for things that have not yet come to pass? Innocent people all across the nation have been wrongfully accused of crimes of terror that have not happened. Our government then will step up and say that they have thwarted another terrorist attack. Innocent people who are banned from boarding airplanes trying to get to home to their families locally or abroad because they have the same ethnic and religious backgrounds as those who crashed planes into skyscrapers (Bear in mind these are the few cases that see the light of the day. Another provision of the USPA Act: they don't have to announce to anyone of anything until criminal charges have already been made. So before the public knows what happened to you, you already have a blemish on your criminal record.). The FAA has a blacklist of people all over the country who have been banned from flying. The FBI, the FAA, and every other government agency and the airliners who this list is shared with ARE NOT OBLIGATED ACCORDING TO THE USPA to share this list AND how these people ended up on the list. These are things that are hardly worth taking into consideration when profiling terrorists (Keep in mind that it was a Caucasian male AND A NATURAL BORN AMERICAN CITIZEN who blew up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, in 1995). While Georgie is preparing for his un-election, he's desperately trying to get the USPA made into permanent law (now it's only temporary) and that he's working additions to the USPA (Dubbed ""Patriot 2""...woulda thought?). I'm not going to promote Michael Moore's new movie, urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 , but I'm going to see it. I have never followed politics more closely in my entire life. To me, this next election holds in the balance the next four years of my life and to me they are pretty important ones to me because I am graduating college. I'm going to be entering the work force with a college degree and I would like to see an improved America and a better economy when I go. I would urge everyone who is of voting age to go vote. Bush has given every voting American every single reason(i.e. The last for years of American history) to vote. Please go to the polls and stay current in national news. It's time for a new leader. Ronald Reagan Trivia Ronald Reagan is still dead. I'm kidding. Actually, Reagan had a photographic memory that helped him a lot in school and in his acting career. How ironic is it that he died with Alzheimer's Disease? I would also like to point out that Reagan ran up the budget deficit and sent troops to die for pointless reasons. I guess history does repeat itself. I would laugh my ass off if the world revere's GW the same as Reagan when he dies.

doc00983,6,"To all my family, training partners, and friends: The marathon went great yesterday. The weather was horrible for spectators and walkers, but spectacular for runners. I finished along with all of my training partners (at least those who registered). I will be updating anyone who I haven't talked to yet, but mostly my update is to say one thing today: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! To my training partners: All of you helped me through the training period as I went from no running to a marathon in 5 short months. All of you offered such a wonderful motivation for long runs and helped me to keep going throughout the numerous injuries and hard training. The marathon was a cinch with friends like you with whom I could laugh and talk and annoy other runners all the way through the marathon. :) All of you also helped to awaken the running spirit in me as I realized that running is something I greatly enjoy and, in part, something I was made to do. Thank you! To my family: You offered a such an encouragement throughout these past months and it was such an overwhelming joy to see you along the course and after the race. Even for those of you who couldn't come or who I didn't see, your encouragement still helped me through some of the toughest miles running thus far. Thank you for the words of the encouragement, for the signs, for standing out in horrible weather just to watch me run by, for dinners, for driving down from Chicago, and for continuing to support me throughout the whole training process and marathon. Thank you! To my friends: Thank you for your words of wisdom and encouragement. Thank you also for those who also came down to stand in horrible weather or even had a desire to come down and stand in horrible weather to watch me run by and/or congratulate me at the finish. All of you have been very helpful to me as I prepared for this marathon. Thank you! To everyone who has stuck with me through my many numerous updates, thank you, even if you didn't read them at all. The updates provided an accountability to me to continue pressing on through injuries, amazingly bad weather, laziness, etc. For those who are interested in seeing my progress since January, all my updates (minus the thought for the day) are posted on my weblog at http://spiderwoebrun.blogspot.com It was all worth it in the end as I pushed through more miles than I have ever run to truly understand what a marathon experience is. Thank you all for being a part of that experience in one form or another. For a brief update of the actual marathon for those who are curious, I will gladly share now. The weather of the day started and stayed horrible in the standard sense, but it was perfect temperature for running and the rain didn't matter at all. We got to the start line about 10 minutes ahead of time but only to find that we started basically at the back of the pack. This didn't matter as we made up ground throughout the marathon. I ran with Consuelo while Lisa and Natalie (the bandit!) broke off from us for a little while. The first 6 miles went by with ease and we began our ascent into Eden Park and Walnut Hills. The hills weren't nearly as bad as I remember on previous runs and we talked all the way up the hills, said hi to the family, and kept right on going. Consuelo and I caught up with Lisa and The Bandit just before mile 9 and we all mostly stuck together through mile 15. From mile 9, the miles went by faster than I can ever remember and it wasn't until mile 18 that I really even started noticing them. The course was gorgeous, and in spite of the weather, I cannot believe the amount of spectators that were out to cheer. Around mile 18, our talking and jokes and laughing slowed a little as we entered into the hardest section of the marathon. We all stayed together (or at least within 50 yards of one another) through mile 21 when Natalie broke off from us and we found some other friends running. The family magically appeared just after mile 21 which was awesome and helped me through the next mile or so. By the time I reached mile 23, I was reaching that running ""wall"" some may have heard of and I had to stop to walk through the water stop. I picked right back up after a minute but had to stop again at mile 24 for water and to walk again. I could easily consider miles 23 & 24 the hardest of my life thus far as the spectators were strangely absent, the miles felt like 15, and each incline felt like Everest. By the time I reached mile 25, I had recovered enough to know I could run into the finish and the family magically appeared just after that again which gave me the adrenaline I needed to power through the last mile. Coming into the final mile is impossible to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced it. After such a long run, to see the family and crowds all cheering for the runners, it was one of the most emotional points of the whole race. If I would not have been so excited about finishing, I would have wept for all those who came out just to cheer. Coming into the finish was absolutely glorious because I was still running, could have kept running, and wanted to weep for joy. Thank you all again for everything. For those family and friends who are runners, I look forward to running with you in about 6 months after I recover. For everyone else, I will talk to you soon. Thank you Thank you Thank you! Tyler"

Julian, being renowned for his extreme height, was paid thirteen grand to act as one of Chewbacca's Rookies on Star Wars III, alongside Natalie Portman (hahah excuse the marketing). Thirteen grand for blowing up a tank, not one line regurtitated. Imagine how excellent it would be, if I stood that tall. I know it is unattainable *blaming genes* (only joking!), but I can dream! heheh no I thank God for who I am & utterly trust Him for who I will become =) Oh well over it. Opps, I guess I forgot to welcome you into my world? My little raetarded world. Hehehehe. It looks like I will be deprived of the outside society for another three weeks or so. I received my English Assessment back which was rather good considering I came second, and nothing ever is learnt in class. Yet, upon receiving this, we were handed another. On King Lear. In Nino's words, 'King Lear can ...' hahaha no not really. But bearing in mind this assessment was literally piled onto the Economics Presentation, Economics Timeline, Database Solution, Database Presentation, Legal Studies Environmental Analysis, Religious Comparison & Legal Studies Presentation on Family Law I already have due. Eight assessments required to be accomplished by the end of three weeks *sigh* . Funny how I get marked absent even though I am present in class. Funny how I get marked here even though I am absent from class. For example, Hume that silly boy! Convinced Mr. Hollis that I was in hospital after enduring a severe asthma attack. Although I was in fact in class all week!

doc00989,5,"My life has come to a standstill. (Or has it always been at a standstill?) I know I have goals. I even know that I have plans to achieve these goals. But I'm just not sure what they are. I know that they exist, just beyond the realm of my consciousness, and that all I have to do is seek them and I can pull them from the corners of my brain out into the open. I just haven't done it yet. I know there are things I want to do with my life, and I have a vague idea what they are, but I haven't put in the simple effort necessary to organize my thoughts and dreams and actually begin to realize them. Each day I think, I should write something today , but then I find myself spending another day and night sitting at the computer and accomplishing nothing. I think of it, but I tell myself, ""No, wait 'til tomorrow. It's too late now; you can spend all day tomorrow on this."" But I never get to it. I want to make something of my life, I want to change the world, but...but I'm afraid that I'll never actually start anything, and I'll end up just like my parents: holding boring jobs in office buildings, working a standard eight hour day, hating my job but lacking another option. Lacking the discipline to build another option. But what the hell is the point of sitting here blogging about this? Why not just get off the computer and actually start? See, that's why I mean. I'm just so messed up right now. I'm such a procrastinator, that I almost will myself to continue putting everything off until the last minute. But when you don't have a deadline for something, there is no last minute, so you just never accomplish it. You end up achieving only the minimum. I don't want to live the bare minimum. Ahh! Help me!

doc00993,1,"I decided this year that I would plant a small vegetable garden. It's something that my dad has always done since as long as I can remember. I thought that it would be a great little project for me, and the results would taste good too. Last night I went to take the dog out for a pee and I decided to look and see how the progress was going. There was about 5 tomatoes that morning,that were of good size, but magically they had seemed to disappear. In the area that I live there are unfortunately a lot of kids. And what is even more unfortunate is that these kids have no supervision or guidance from any of the adults. It turns out that these kids decided that it would a great idea to steal all the tomatoes and smash them on the sidewalk a few feet away. Now growing up, I was taught that I should respect other people's property and things. But apparently now a days that doesn't seem to matter. I have spent a lot of time, effort and money on these plants, and I am not willing to give it up because of some fucked up kid. You would also think that if you talked to the parents of the children then they would straighten them out. But they don't give a fuck about their children, sometimes I wonder if they even know their kids' names. All they do is sit on their ass and say that they are not responsible for their kids' actions. Wait till the social workers come banging on their door, we will see if their tone changes. When it comes down to it, it's not really the kids fault if they don't know any better. But goddamnit, leave my motherfucking tomatoes alone."

I was fine last week, but when Jared starting talking about Amanda growing up and serving as her Youth Minister, it brought back memories and made me again realize that even though when they come around it seems like they've never been gone, they have and there is a void there. I couldn't help but shed a few tears. We went on to the reception where we ate some wonderful food and danced, danced, danced again. It was a time for fun, friends, and pleasant conversation. Clay and Mandy tormented me: ""Congratulations on catching the garter."" ""I didn't catch it."" ""Of course you didn't! You're not going to with your arms crossed."" And even though our church stinks and is not functional for regular church activities, it's a great place for weddings and funerals.

So why did I call myself a homemaker? what else should I call myself then? Maybe it's because due to the fact that I'm living with my mother-in-law right now.

doc01009,2,"What does true community mean? Does it mean developing the character of Christ in each individual that lives in community? How do we discern true community from community ? Hey, I also perfer team leadership, but team leadership (in my thinking) doesn't equal true community. Team leadership can be proactive, reactive, passive, good or bad depending on the character and filters each leader brings to the team. Currently, many faith communities are lead by baby boomers...who often wear modernism's filters. And one of the faliures of modern ministry is the neglect (or possibly a misapplication) of discipleship. For too long we have assumed that a new convert will develop kingdom character�Pray with them, baptize them and they will automatically live by kingdom principles (which are countercultural). God saves him/her...they become part of the (true?) faith community...give them a regular dose of linear, rational preaching & teaching and ""presto"" they have developed the mind of Christ. We know better. People don't overcome the old life that easy (which by the way is much more natural and easier to live). We have to provide a forum that helps people learn to seek reconcillation instead of legal assistance; to walk the extra mile and to turn the other cheek. From my experience (�and I am painting with a broad brush here) we still don't do this well. Maybe some communities do�if so I'd love to hear their stories. Modernism created some monsters that will not roll over and die each time we point them out...I see the above paragraph as ""one of those monsters."" I guess what I 'm attempting to say is that we're all traveling along this continuum of time and, for me, it's often difficult to see clearly (maybe) because we don't fully understand or see what lies ahead. But as we travel through this POMO tunnel (headed to something else called another era) we all encounter the remnants of modernism. All transitions must put up with remnant of the past (especially early on---the further into the tunnel we travel the fewer leftovers). Remember the Jews who wanted to carry circumcisions into a new era? So my point: maybe we talk ""emerging and new era"" but (unknowingly) continue to practice much of our ministry in a modern context. What say you?"

It's like climbing a freezing mountain coz there's sunshine, warmth and sheter on the other side but, every time you look up, having climbed for hours and fucking hours , the top doesn't seem to have got any closer at all... Brane&I not coping V. well at the moment. Spent most of last week in bed - asleep. Unusually. Yes, not even knitting or watching telly. Actually crashed out. It's THAT bad.... OKay, so it's a blip. And I know it's mostly coz of the therapy stuff stirring the murky shit up from the bottom of the bottle that I've been studiously allowing to settle for the last 20 years. I kinda expected that . But it means that I'm a whole lot less able to cope with other cuntstacks and numbnuts fucking with my hed. And, just at the moment, they seem to be queuing up. I mean, fuck, do I have the big, pink, flashing, neon 'Kick Me' sign stuck to the top of my hed again, or what? I dunno: but I'm in hermit mode again....partly coz I just don't wanna be around people when I'm, like, this feeble, zoned-out, useless and pathetic; partly coz being asleep in bed all the time does tend to limit the time one has to spare for social interaction; but, at the moment, mostly coz this sudden back-swing means I'm right back to where I was a few months ago in terms of leaving the house - to wit. currently I am not able to most of the time. I'm now at the stage where it takes thought, care and deep breathing even to leave my fucking bedroom, sometimes; and even the rest of the house feels like an unfamiliar, threatening, unsafe landscape. It's pissing me off. Quite a fucking lot, actually. Apart from the technical and logistical hassles of not, for example, being able even to walk the 100 fucking yards round the bleeding corner to the fucking postbox to post a sodding letter. I realised the other night (while I was asleep - go figure) that, since Christmas, I have only been out in daylight three times - when I wan't going to some kind of medical appt. or other. (And even that's always with Heff; and half of the time I still have to spend hours psyching myself up to it, or trying not to think about it and dashing around at the last minute, so it's happened before I have a chance to hyperventilate and throw up, or totally bottle out) I fucking hate this. Can you spell 'p-a-t-h-e-t-i-c'? Mostly, I don't fucking understand how it works - WHY can I go out at night, or in a car, with relatively little problem; but try walking round the corner for a loaf of bread and I black out? WHY can't I even travel as far as my parents' house, or to see Gran, without becoming majorly anxious and panicky - when I'm in a CAR the whole way, for fuck's sake? Why am I now finding it difficult to go anywhere there's people AT ALL - worse thatn I've ever been; but yet, in other ways, I'm so much better that it's almost unrecognisable? It makes no logical sense. There's no real pattern I can grasp; no cycle I can really see clearly enough to break; and no improvement or change I can rely on to last for very long, or not to come back worse than before. I HAVE been getting better; and a lot of those gains are still there: overall I'm less geniunely mad than I was. But some of the most annoying and debilitating, and breathtakingly cruel, of the individual 'events' or 'difficulties', associated with when I've been at my very worst, seem suddenly to have popped up again on their own. As in, ""fuck, didn't I deal with you already? I thought you'd gone when I stopped lapsing into catatonia/trying to kill people/ breaking everything in the house / wanting to jump into the dock in the middle of the night?"" Ha. Like anything's EVER that simple....I must have unconsciously lapsed into some kind of weird twilight-zone state of optimism, hopefullness or contentedness there, for a second. Silly me! Having thus moaned and whined and wallowed (I'm allowed: it's MY blog. If I'm making you reach for the scalpel-blades, or the bumper-family-fun-sized-pack of ultra-strong paracetamol and the quart of scotch, fuck off and read something bingley-jingly-sparkly and ""happi"" (*bounce*) instead) I feel a bit better today. This is coz the Group finally started, so it's not the big black at the back of my hed any more, and they seem pretty unthreatening - as small herds of lunatics go; and coz I went out and walked about in the sun; and I got on a bus on my own; and coz I got to spend some time out of the house with people I lurve - including the person I most adore (wizened chunklets notwithstanding) having some fun. Tho it suddenly occurred to me on the bus: I've just let myself in for FOUR HOURS of therapy a week!!! FOUR fucking hours!! For at least the next two months. What the...? If the hospital people get back to me within the next eight weeks, I'm going to have no time for anything that isn't pretending to be treatment. (You know - all the deathlessly exciting and stimulating activities with which my hectic, madcap lifestyle is currently stuffed.) Okay.....I'm currently rooting around under the desk for my 'escape from earth' kit: I feel in DESPERATE need of my fuck-proof hed and my portable hole, all of a sudden. Still, Dave and I had a bit of a mutual support session this afternoon. That made me feel lots better. I think we agree that true friends are few and far between; and that people, generally, are selfish, unreliable, likely to drag you into their troubles if they can, neurotic, illogical, disappointing and pretty-much best avoided at all cost. He was telling me about the latest round of crapfullness and social futility he's going through - why do people always like to work off their own misery on innocent bystanders if they can? Anyway, he's feeling a bit low today - coz of the gasman trapping him in the flat for two-anna-half hours - and, as usual, feels there is really no-one he can kinda rely on in his immediate environment. This is because he knows it will end up either being used against him or seen as some kinda permission to tell him how he should be running his life. And, like he said: that's just the people who are even remotely bothering to pretend to be vaguely interested and/or there for him. Trouble with his job is the endless hangers-on. I gather he's having that unpleasant Gestalt moment of nasty revelation - the one where he realises that people he considered real friends are, in fact, really only in it for themselves and what they can get from him; and then only when it suits them or they can be bothered. Simple solution: he's decided he's just quietly opting out - not going to allow himself to be dragged into the giant shitfest he thinks - knows - is approaching. Sounds like a plan to me. Plus, it means he's likely to be round a bit more as a result. (Does that last remark count as schadenfreude?? I hope not - it wasn't really meant to be selfish gloating...!?) But I do so love Dave. He's totally the Man, yanno? Down-to-earth, breath-of-fresh-air and all that; but he's just cool to hang out with: realaxing, fun, stimulating and all that stuff. You can say anything to him coz he's not judgemental. He cares; but he's forgiving and accepting of stuff - just goes his own way. I love that he's such a pragmatist: I love his total lack of bullshit, manipulation and refreshing ability to see past the end of his own nose; and to accept responsibility for things without it being a whole, big, waily 'mea culpa' deal. He can talk about all the shit that's happening to him in a calm, rational and constructive way. He's not into the whole 'poor me' thing: he's got a strong sense of self-respect that means we can talk, share, and neither is expecting the other to somehow DO anything. Just, well, listen, is all. Make observations, empathise. Offer support. Occasionally take the piss. That kinda thing. No pressure. Overall, Dave's doing a pretty fine job of being positive, under the circumstances. He's neither wallowing and expecting gratuitous, pointless, sympathy (I think he'd throttle anyone who tried it); nor is he trying, unrealistically, to brush his feelings under the rug and pretend nothing's happening, everything's fine, business in Daveland as usual. It's a pity that, when people see how strong, pragmatic, in control and unsentimental he is, they seem, often, to mistake it for a lack of feeling. As a result, I think lots of people think he doesn't need people to be there for him, sometimes, when he's taking shite. It's just that while he might need someone, he doesn't want any- and everyone involved in his life - crashing around like a herd of wild pigs, trampling on and picking over all his soft and wobbly bits and peering into dark, slime-infested corners with a bloody-great torch. Of course, I have to keep reminding myself that this is not necessarily miraculous singularity: just that he's an adult. I almost forgot what one looks like. And I'm not talking how many years you happen to have been on the planet, either: clearly, this is no predicator of maturity. Whatever - he's such a great bloke and I feel really priviledged to have him as a mate. *thinks* So it's not all bad, then. Still got a couple of people out there who seem to give a shit, and be willing to accept with grace that I am a useless cunt through no choice of mine, and are not so utterly narcissistic that they take it personally. (NB. Sarah doesn't count in the above: she's taken endless shite from me and I'm not surprised she's pissed off. I would be, too.) Crap is a good sorter: you find out who your real friends are. It's often surprising - in a positive way: they tend not to be who you think they will be. As well as the, sadly predictable, disappointment of having to let go of people you really care about because they can't - or won't. God, I'm waffling bollox. Like I say, brainfuk. I'm off to pray to the ""Recently-Deceased-Obscenely-Rich-Distant-Relatives-You-Didn't-Know-You-Had-But-Who-Have-Now-Died-And-Left-Their-Entire-Fortune-To-You"" fairy. This is because Fate turned up with the dump-truck again this week: the cat cost us £75 at the vet, we have a hugely overdue phone bill, are about to become telly-less and washing-machine-less, we have absolutely NO money whatsoever, and we STILL can't get the fucking digi-cam to work so we can raise capital by flogging everything we own on eBay. I wasn't meant to be poor: I'm just no good at it, yanno?? Elderly-Cat Pie, anyone? Bit stringy; but, pound-for-pound, at least three times the price of half-decent Beluga.... *sigh* ."
doc01027,2,"Everybody keeps telling me that I have a stupid grin on my face all the time. I can't help it that I smile so much. It's not like I'm happy all the time. I battle the shitty and meloncholy moods too like everybody else, but I don't really show it! I guess the way I look at it is if you smile to someone, it brightens their day a little bit longer, right? NO....not really. I just like getting people paranoid!!! Smiling makes me look more devious and mysterious. Yeah, that's it.....more mysterious!"

doc01029,5,"Hey Im on msn talking to Claire and Josh. I had a fantastic day today with Claire, it was so fun. But now im kinda angry coz im taling to Josh. I dont trust him. I know even now after it has been ages since he has been in my life, i am still affected by the past. I need closure from the whole situation but he wants to be friends and all i want is closure and then for him to go away. It may sound mean but thats wat i feel i want. Comments or advice would be really helpful right now because i am so confused about the whole situation. Atm only Kate knows how it is all affecting me but im gonna say it now, because i dont care who reads it. I havent had a bf since Jim which was like 12 months ago. Sure ive had opportunities, but at first iwas like nah i wanna stay single, but really that was just hiding the truth. Then it was i dont like them in that way. But now the reason is that i want to make sure that i really like them because i dont want what happened with josh to happen again. It may sound stupid but past experiences affect people differently and this is how this particular experience has affected me. He wants me to yell and scream at him but what is the point? Lisa xx P.S maybe another day ill post the convo on here."

I wanted to call people to chit chat last night but the only thing on the people's minds are "" are you ready?, Aren't you nervous?"". Shit, I wanted to hear something besides poetry yesterday. Oh, here is something good. I was talking to Mike on Saturday and the subject of favorite firearm came to the surface. I have always fancied the Glock 20; 40 cal. He comes out and says its a typical thug ghetto gun. I am quick to argue this point because I know for a fact Glocks are one of the best firearms out there. Getting to the point - Glocks no longer sell multi-capacity magazines. I was hurt when he told me this. When I had my glock, it was a 17 and one { 17 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber}. Here I am thinking "" wow, that is a significant number of less shots "". Why the fuck would anyone need 17 shots in the streets you ask ? Well, when you are a loner and you engage a group bigger then 4 or 5 - the more shots the merrier. Off to work to leave early The mind has to be clear today Fish Peace, Love, Porkchops"

doc01034,4,"May 19, 2004 I'm convinced that the reason people who happen to be parents generally look so - um - wizened compared with their non-parent peers is the fucking sleep deprivation. If parenthood has a religion, that's it. Thou shalt not sleep. Ever. Xanthe didn't sleep through the night until she was over eight months old . Go on, my childfree friends. Grin yerself silly. I understand. And even now that she sleeps, the kids still get sick and the circus begins all over again. This week Henry has an ear infection, and last night my night went something like this: Xanthe goes to sleep at 8:45; Henry at 9:15pm. We go to bed at 11pm. Xanthe cries at 12:30am. I am so out of it that I pick her up and nurse her back to sleep. I thought it must've been 5am, I was so disoriented. Otherwise I would've made the little goober cry it out. Henry starts hollering at 2:30am. I go in because Eug was up with him the night before. He is feverish. I change his diaper, dose him with Tylenol, get him a sippy of milk and sit on the couch with him in the darkened living room watching ""Colonial House"" on PBS for 20 minutes before I put him back to bed, hoping that the Tylenol has begun to kick in to reduce the fever. At 4am, he is hollering ""MAMA!"" again and again at top volume. A command rather than a request. He doesn't sound too upset, so I decide to see if he'll zip it eventually and fall back asleep. I wait about twenty minutes, during which time neither Eug nor Xanthe awaken. Amazing. No go on H falling back asleep. He continues to holler intermittently until he is reduced to a very anxious, high-pitched cry. Very sad, indeed. I haul my keister out of bed again and get him. This time we sit in the very dark living room with a sippy but no TV for ten minutes, just calming down. His hair is wet with sweat and he leans his head on my shoulder so sweetly that I'm glad I got him. But I am oh, so tired. At 6am, Xanthe awakens. I nurse her and she is crabby and looking like she's going to stay awake. I respond with ""Tough noogies, kid"" and plunk her back in her crib. I am NOT getting up for the day at 6am. Especially not after the night I just had. At 7am, Xanthe makes it clear that she's ready to rock and roll. My only saving grace is that Blue's Clues is on TVO, and I can squeak in an extra 20 minutes of half-sleep on the couch while she gazes with rapt attention at the screen. And the AAP recommends that children under two watch NO television? And I recommend that they kiss my fat ass. Anyway, before I forget to write about this, something else is happening to me in recent years. I'm getting to be more of a wuss about all kinds of things. For years, I have loved things like extreme roller coasters and true crime and horror movies. Now, the thought of getting on a roller coaster makes me think nervously ""But what if something goes horribly wrong?"" You'd think that I'd get more reckless with each year closer to inevitable death, and not the reverse. Seems like if there's any time to be cautious, it's when you're young and you have many a decade in front of you if you're careful and a little lucky. But, no. I'm beginning to remind myself of an old hen with a nervous disorder, and it's a little unsettling when I look at myself objectively. The true crime stuff is very disturbing to me, now, too. I think I've written about this before, so I won't belabor the point. But the thought of someone hurting my family makes me both very, very angry and very, very sick. I have probably spent way too much time thinking about it, but in the event that I am ever the victim of a crime, I have already braced myself for how I would want to react, in the hopes that in those seconds, I will kick into autopilot and KILL WITH MY BARE HANDS THE UNLUCKY SON OF A BITCH WHO'S TRYING TO HARM ME. Or die trying, and right there. No way is somebody getting me to go anywhere - and I don't give a shit if they threaten my kids. I'll take me chances right then and there. Then, there's the horror movie stuff. I used to LOVE these. I still go see them all the time, but now it seems I enjoy them less and less. We went to see the remake of Dawn of the Dead, which was very well done. But there's one scene that really keeps bothering me. In the beginning, a husband and wife are sharing what will be, unbeknownst to them, their last normal night on earth. They have no idea that the zombie plague is sweeping the world. They awaken to the little girl next door at their bedroom door. The husband sits up sleepily and, seeing that she appears to be injured, goes to her. She lunges for his neck and chaos ensues. The result after a few tense moments is that the wife escapes through the bathroom window to her car (highly implausible, especially given that she somehow instinctively grabs for her car keys) and tears off down the street. It's actually a really great scene, because it takes one of those oh-so-normal McMansion neighborhoods and peppers it with fire and blood and fear and violence. The safe and everyday juxtaposed against the what-the-fuck-is-going-ON-here. But the part that I cannot get out of my head is the scene as she drives away, with her now-zombie husband hauling fucking ASS after her on foot, wanting to take a bite out of her. You see him through the rear car window, trucking like he's running an Olympic sprint , for God's sake, and without so much as a sniff in another direction to warn you of what's about to happen, he swerves and in less than a second he is just *on* some poor clueless guy standing on his lawn watching it all go down. It was just so fucking fast and so brutal that I have been creeped out by that image ever since. I have no idea why I should be so bothered by what I can logically admit is a very clever execution of a very effective scene. But bothered I am. So I'm getting old and turning into - yes, I gotta say it - a pussy. Not like I was ever jumping out of airplanes in my youth, but that's just it: I was never that bold before, and now I'm retreating into my shell like an elderly turtle. An elderly turtle with a wicked temper, too. OK, before I go and seeing as how I already mentioned it: Are y'all watching Colonial House on PBS? I love these series. I intend to torment my kids by making them watch every episode when they are older. (I also intend to enjoy their eye-rolling when I remind them that they should be grateful for the embarrassment of riches they enjoy in this life.) I asked Eug if he'd ever go along with it if I wanted to apply for one of those things in the future. He looked wary but could obviously see the zeal in my eye. Figuring that it's a safe bet that I'd never be sufficiently organized to get the application in on time, he agreed that he'd do it. Then he grinningly speculated that maybe we could get on ""Cave Man House"" and he could drag me around by my hair all day. What a smartass I married. Anyway, before I forget: For those of you watching Colonial House, can I just say how fucking obnoxious it is to see all these dumbass people on the show who don't want to observe the Sabbath, or cover their heads, or whatever else was called for in Colonial Times. Hello? You signed up for the experience, god damn it. Leave your modern whining at the door and shut your cakehole. LIVE THE LIFE AS COLONIAL PEOPLE REALLY LIVED IT. Isn't that the fucking point?"

doc01038,6,"Once more into the breach, as the internet has not yet been restored to my household. The wonder of the Library is that it's almost free. What you give up, is privacy and a little bit of pride. It's always amusing to see the difference between Barnes & Noble, with it's pristine carpets, new books, wide selection, designer coffee, and the Public Library, with it's dingy carpets,unilluminating help, and ratty reference section. The Library can sometimes have works the store does not, but the funding tends to even it out a little bit. The perfect marriage between these is the University Library. With the mandate to support their local scholars, a budget to match, and the subscriptions to research periodicals a mad scientist can envy, the University Library is a much more pleasant place to steal internet access, and get a little real-worldish research in. It's sad that when I was a child, my mother was always telling me to get my face out of the book and join the real world. Now I see books, and think of them as more real than where I usually am. In other news, a recent brush with the urlLink MAN has given me a new respect for the powers that be. In respect for that, I've upped my PGP Key size, and renewed my CCW. Kidding aside, I would like to say one thing. It is a dangerous thing when people need not take responsibility for their actions personally. Hierarchy and impersonal organizations allow one to ""just follow orders"" or be ""defending the country"". As Bertrand Russel once observed ""murder is against the law everywhere, unless it is in large numbers to the sound of trumpets and flags."". Be wary of allowing someone to do for a government or organization, what you could not concience allowing him to do for himself. For he is still doing it, in his name's or another.

doc01045,4,"Spring 1989, The Reagan Years Special Commemorative Issue Published by the Heritage Foundation THE TEN LEGACIES OF RONALD REAGAN Prosperity at Home, Peace Abroad BURTON YALE PINES When Ronald Reagan stepped down as president on January 20, 1989, he had served eight years. This itself is an extraordinary accomplishment; very few American presidents have served two full terms. In this century, in fact, only three others have done so: Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower-and both Wilson and Eisenhower were in ill health their final years in office. Yet Ronald Reagan's greatest accomplishment is not simply staying in power for eight years. His greatest achievement is the legacy he leaves his successor. George Bush leads an America that has been changed profoundly by the Reagan Revolution. This revolution has transformed America as significantly as have two previous presidential revolutions: the political revolution of Andrew Jackson in the 1830s and that of Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s. Just as the American government in the 19th century was shaped by the Jackson legacy, and just as American government in this century has been shaped by the Roosevelt legacy, so the next American presidents, for several decades, will be shaped and influenced and limited by the Reagan legacy. A Historic Turning Point Ronald Reagan's presidency was the most important in a half-century, perhaps in a century. What I would like to discuss with you today are the 10 most important legacies Ronald Reagan leaves America and America's next president. George Bush is very lucky to be following Ronald Reagan-much luckier than Reagan was. George Bush finds himself leading a nation that is much healthier, stronger, more confident, more optimistic, and even much happier than the nation that Reagan found himself leading in 1981. Before we start looking at the Reagan legacies, we should recall what America was like in 1981 when Ronald Reagan became president. It was a dreadful, terrible time in America and for America. In the 1970s, the U.S. had been on the retreat on almost every front. We retreated in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, and in the face of the OPEC oil cartel. We surrendered the Panama Canal. We closed our eyes to Soviet violations of important treaties. By our actions, we allowed the Soviets to invade Afghanistan. And then there was Iran. There we allowed the overthrow of the Shah's government, which was our good friend and vital to our security. And we allowed ourselves to be held hostage for 444 days. At home, too, things were terrible in the 1970s. The U.S. surrendered to high taxes, inflation, gasoline shortages, to massive government interference in the economy and in the lives of individual Americans. We surrendered to crime on the streets and to low standards in our schools. Perhaps worst of all, we seemed to abandon the most important dream in American history: the dream that we can make tomorrow better than today and that America's children are entitled to believe that they will lead better lives than their parents. Instead of traditional American optimism and dreams of hope, we were told-and we began to believe-that less is more, that small is beautiful, that resources are disappearing and never will be replaced, and that yesterday was better than tomorrow ever will be. The 1970s were a dreadful decade for my country. The 1980s have been much better, thanks in large measure to Ronald Reagan's leadership and the 10 most constructive and important legacies he leaves behind. Formula for Economic Growth Growth, as we know, is very important. It is economic growth that makes it possible for living standards to increase for nearly every American. It is growth that defeats poverty. It is growth that fuels technological, scientific, and medical progress. It is growth that enables us to have more options in life, to have more leisure, to learn and do more things-to become the well-rounded, creative human being about whom Karl Marx wrote in 1844 in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Reagan reminded America that government cannot create economic growth and that government generally is the enemy of economic growth. Yet Reagan also taught us that there is something that government can do. It can create an environment that is friendly to growth. Government can help unleash human imagination and creativity. It can encourage men and women to take economic risks and then allow them to get big rewards when they succeed. Of course, it also must allow them to fail and pay the price of failure. Reagan taught us that the hero of economic growth is the entrepreneur. This is a French word that technically means someone who undertakes to do something. But when translated into the American language, entrepreneur means much more. It is the entrepreneur who gets the new ideas, takes the risks, tries the new things. It is the entrepreneur who works long and hard, who finds the money for risky ventures, who breaks the rules, who is the pioneer and the inventor. Truly, entrepreneurs are the heroes of a growing economy. Government, of course, cannot be an entrepreneur. Bureaucracies do not take risks; they are not pioneers; they do not get new ideas; and they cannot move quickly. But government can encourage individuals to be entrepreneurs. Ronald Reagan did this by lowering taxes, by reducing government regulation and interference in the economy, and by making it easier for individuals to accumulate the money they can use for new economic enterprises. This is what Reagan did. And what are the results? We have had the longest period of economic growth in peacetime in American history-probably world history. A record number of new American businesses have been created; a record number of new jobs have been created (and, in fact, experts now worry about a labor shortage in America); we are producing more new products and new ideas and are doing so more efficiently than at any time in our history. There is a new dynamism in America. And Ronald Reagan once again proved that capitalism works-that free market economics succeeds. This is a wonderful legacy for America-and the world. New Federalism As you may know, federalism has been the political principle upon which my nation has been organized and governed. My country is called, after all, the United States. This name reflects the fact that the various states united together to create a nation. When the states did this they gave some important powers to the new national government. But they also kept many powers for themselves. This arrangement, this division of powers, is known as the federal system. This is not just some abstract political theory for professors and philosophers. The federal system has determined who has had power in the U.S. and has given a great deal of power to the states. This is a good idea because the states are much closer to the people than is the national government. Thus, the states are more responsive to the people. Giving great powers to the states also is a good idea because it recognizes the enormous diversity of the U.S. What is good for one section of the nation, after all, may not be good for all sections. For America's first 150 years as a nation, the federal system was balanced and worked well. But things began changing in the 1930s and 1940s. The huge national economic programs during the Depression and the huge effort to fight World War II gave the national government great new powers. This weakened the federal system. What we saw in Washington was the growth of hundreds of new government agencies with huge new bureaucracies. These were unfriendly to the people, unsympathetic, unresponsive, and, of course, uncreative. At the same time, because so much power had shifted to Washington, Americans, and even state and local officials, began losing their confidence in their own ability to solve problems. They began looking to Washington for solutions for almost everything. This was something new in America-and something dangerous. Reagan has invoked words, thoughts, and images that have touched American hearts and have recalled a special pride we long had in our country. Ronald Reagan has reversed this. His policies have restored power to the states and cities, and reduced the power of the central government in Washington. Though state officials at first hesitated and were reluctant to accept this new power, now they are enthusiastic about it. Once again the states are the laboratories of new ideas. And great new ideas are coming from the states-in housing issues, education reform, help for the poor, and ways to clean the environment. Restoring the balance to America's federal system is a great Reagan legacy. Privatization Privatization is a clumsy, terrible word for a rather simple and sound idea. Privatization is a process by which private companies and groups provide services that had been provided by the government. There are many advantages to this. First, it reduces the size of the government and its role in society; in itself, this is a very good thing. Second, it reduces government expenses because private firms almost always can provide services at lower cost than can government agencies. And third, it is more efficient and more responsive to the needs of the people. Various states and cities have been pioneers in privatization. Former government services now provided by private firms include fire protection, garbage collection, bus service, prison management, and even neighborhood court systems to resolve minor disputes. The Reagan Doctrine is a true revolutionary policy. It proclaims that the future belongs to democracy, not to Soviet-imposed dictatorships. Ronald Reagan began the privatization of federal services and programs. For example, he sold Conrail, one of America's largest railroads, to a private firm. Reagan also began the process of allowing private companies to build rockets to launch payloads into space. While much remains to be done with privatization, Reagan demonstrated that the president can use the private sector to deal with problems that in the past would have been addressed by government. Checking Judicial Activism I realize that the appointment of American judges is an issue to which foreigners pay little attention. Yet it is very important because court decisions have a great impact on government policies. For most of American history, the courts respected the Constitution's division of powers. According to this division, the Congress makes the laws, the president enforces the laws, and the courts rule when there is a dispute about the laws. In recent decades, however, the federal courts, particularly the highest court, called the Supreme Court, have become more aggressive. They have taken some of the power from the Congress and president and even have begun to make laws. This violated a long tradition in the U.S. and threatened to upset the delicate balance between the different parts of the central government. Ronald Reagan promised to stop this. He did so by appointing judges to the court who respect the traditional role of the court. He appointed judges who are against the activist role of the court. Reagan appointed three of the Supreme Court's nine judges and he appointed 361 of the federal court system's 743 judges. You may know that these judges keep their jobs for the rest of their lives and cannot be removed by new presidents. Thus, they will influence court decisions for decades. Indeed, Reagan deliberately appointed young people as judges. Rebuilding America's Military Might Throughout the 1970s, under Republican and Democratic presidents, the U.S. became militarily weaker. What did this mean? It meant that the U.S. would find it increasingly difficult to fulfill its security commitments to other nations. It meant that it was becoming increasingly questionable whether the U.S. would be able to keep its promises to Western Europe or Japan or Israel or Southeast Asia. It meant that the U.S. was not able to deal with Moscow from a position of strength. Ronald Reagan changed this. Today we can keep our promises. Today we again can be trusted as allies. And today we certainly can deal with Moscow from a position of strength. Because of what Ronald Reagan did, the U.S. has a greater military capability than at any time in a quarter-century. The rebuilding of the American arsenal has changed what the Soviets at one time liked to call the ""global correlation of forces."" This correlation now has tilted toward the U.S. This should please and reassure America's friends around the world-and certainly here in China. We now are a more reliable friend and again a true superpower that can block Soviet aggression and expansion. This, of course, gives the new U.S. president valuable flexibility in dealing with Moscow. Grappling with the Bear For too long America gave Moscow the advantage in negotiations. Those who were making U.S. policy seemed to feel that any treaty with the Soviets is better than no treaty. As such, Americans were always willing to make concessions to Moscow; we were afraid of sticking to our position if this would mean that the negotiations would break down. The result of this was the series of Soviet gains at the bargaining table: SALT I, the ABM Treaty, cultural exchanges, SALT II. Ronald Reagan changed this. His lesson to future presidents is simple, but it requires determination and self-confidence. There are two parts to this lesson. First, you can only deal with Moscow from a position of strength; this is why it is so important that the U.S. arsenal has been rebuilt. Reagan, after all, delayed serious negotiations with the Soviets until near the end of his first term - until the U.S. again was militarily strong. You here in China know very well that you cannot deal with Moscow if you are weak; the Soviets will not be generous, will not be compassionate, will not do you kind favors. Second, Reagan was willing to allow negotiations to collapse, He did not panic when Moscow used its typical technique of bluster, threats, and intimidation. If the Soviet delegates wanted to get up and walk away from the negotiating table, Reagan let them do it. In the past, however, Americans would have made new concessions simply to keep the Soviets from walking away; this is what happened at the 1972 and 1979 SALT talks. It was very different with Reagan. When Moscow gave Reagan the ultimatum that it would stop negotiating arms reductions with the U.S. if the U.S. deployed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe, Reagan did not bend. He responded by deploying the missiles. Liberals in the U.S., and many experts at the State Department, were shocked by this. They said that Reagan would destroy the entire ""arms control process."" But Reagan said that if the Soviets wanted to walk away from the talks, then let them walk away. They would come back to the table, he said. And he was right. They came back. And they ultimately accepted the INF Treaty that the U.S. originally had proposed. Then remember what happened at the Reykjavik summit? There Gorbachev issued his ultimatum: there could be a dramatic arms reduction only if the U.S. would abandon the Strategic Defense Initiative, or SDI. Some previous presidents probably would have bowed to this Soviet pressure. American liberals were urging Reagan to do so. But Reagan again stood firm. He said again: Let the Russians walk away; they will be back. And again he was right. They have come back and they have resumed the START talks for deep arms reductions. To you here in China all of this may seem obvious and simplistic. You long ago learned that you have to be strong and firm when dealing with Moscow. But this has not been so obvious to American presidents and to American diplomats in the past half-century. Reagan has set a very important example for future presidents. The Reagan Doctrine The Reagan Doctrine is a policy of true liberation. It recognizes that national liberation movements in the Third World can be on the side of freedom and democracy and that the U.S. can help these national liberation movements win. It breaks with the 1970s when the U.S. had become isolationist and was unwilling to remain involved in the world. Instead, the Reagan Doctrine proclaims that the U.S. is ready to challenge and even roll back the Soviet Empire. This is what we did in Grenada. And this is what we are doing-and our countries are working together on this in Afghanistan and Cambodia. And you should be working with us in Nicaragua. There, too, Soviet expansion should be blocked. The Reagan Doctrine is a true revolutionary policy. It proclaims that the future belongs to democracy, not to Soviet-imposed dictatorships. And rather than being on the retreat, as they were in the 1970s, the world's democracies are now on the offensive. This is a marvelous legacy for Reagan to leave. Demise of the Brezhnev Doctrine For two decades, we in the U.S., in the West, and in Asia were told by Moscow that the global correlation of forces had shifted in the Soviet favor and that this shift was permanent. We often believed this. This, in effect, is what the Brezhnev Doctrine was proclaiming: that once a country joins the Soviet camp, it must remain forever in the Soviet camp. The most dramatic example of this, of course, was the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago. We often believed the Brezhnev Doctrine. It seemed that it would be impossible for a nation to leave the Soviet camp. To this, however, Ronald Reagan said nonsense. This is the meaning of the Reagan Doctrine and this is the meaning of Grenada, Angola, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Nicaragua. The message here is that the Soviets are not invincible. And the reality here is that Moscow has been on the retreat. With this legacy, Reagan reversed the momentum of an entire generation. George Bush should continue challenging the Brezhnev Doctrine-and carry the challenge to Eastern Europe, to the Baltic states and even to the ""republics"" inside the Soviet Union itself. Defense Technology with a Human Face The Strategic Defense Initiative may turn out to be the most important Reagan policy because it could change the world. It could end the nightmare of nuclear holocaust. SDI is a moral and humanitarian policy. After all, if government has any legitimate function it is to protect its citizens. This SDI would do. SDI also is a policy that could end Moscow's ability to intimidate and blackmail the U.S. and the rest of the world. We all know the little secret about the Soviet Union. It is a superpower only because of its nuclear arsenal, its ability to destroy the United States. SDI would deny Moscow this ability. With SDI, the Soviet Union no longer would be a superpower. It instead would be seen for what it really is-economically and politically just a large Third World nation. Of course, Reagan merely launched SDI. The program still has very far to go. We even may discover that SDI cannot work. Most likely, however, it will work. And if it does, the shadow of nuclear nightmare that has darkened the world since 1945 will begin to lift. Can there be any better legacy than this? Restoring Confidence in the Presidency Reagan's final legacy is that he reignited Americans' optimism and restored Americans' faith in the presidency. We had become very pessimistic in the 1970s. We saw one president after another fail-Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter. We started believing that America's best days were behind it. The mood in the 1970s was tragic. It reversed two centuries of American thinking. The history of my country, as you probably know, has been a history of confidence and optimism. We have felt that frontiers are not limits or barriers, but rather that frontiers are to be conquered. There is a new dynamism in America. Ronald Reagan once again has proved that capitalism works-that free market economics succeeds. We have regarded our nation in the way that you often have viewed yours, as the Middle Kingdom, occupying the center of the universe. We have believed that the United States is a very special place, a promised land with a special mission. And we started doubting all of this during the dreadful 1970s. Ronald Reagan reversed and healed this. He did this by his policies, by his successes, by his personal example and optimism, and by his inspiring words. We've already discussed his policies and successes. Now we must note the example he provides as president. Unlike Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter, Ronald Reagan was not destroyed by the presidency. He was not ground down. He enjoyed being president; he was comfortable being president. This has helped Americans regain their confidence in the presidency. Touching American Hearts And then, of course, there are Ronald Reagan's words. I am not sure how they will sound to you, with your very different culture and history. But Reagan has invoked words, thoughts, and images that have touched American hearts and have recalled a special pride we long had in our country. Frequently, Reagan talked about America as a promised land. He called America a ""Zion in the wilderness,"" and ""a city on the hill."" He said often, in speaking to Congress or on television addressing the nation, that America is ""the last best hope of man on earth."" SDI is a policy that could end Moscow's ability to intimidate and blackmail the U.S. and the rest of the world. You may remember what Reagan said at Fudan University when he visited Shanghai in 1984. He said: ""We're an optimistic people. Like you, we inherited a vast land of endless skies, tall mountains, rich fields, and open prairies. It made us see the possibilities in everything. It made us hopeful."" These may be only words, but they are words that have been combined with dynamic action and successful policies. And thus, these words have been powerful and have had a powerful influence. George Bush is lucky to find himself leading a people again confident in America and again proud of America. This then is the legacy that Ronald Reagan leaves his people. It is an impressive legacy. It is a marvelous legacy. And it will influence the direction and policies of America for years to come.

All seems fine with the school, except for passing the staircase, where a strange whirring noise could be heard. Surprised, I pay it little attention and proceed down the media hall and head out looking for David (I owed him money for a CD I was purchasing) on my alternate locker hall (the other half of the Junior Hall). To my great surprise, all but a couple of the lights on the hallway are out. It would have been pitch-black had it not been for that sporadic lighting. Undeterred (if such a word exists), I go to my actual locker (where the hallway is fully lit), unload my stuff, and then head to the media center. From there, word escapes that we're all on temporary power, which explained why merely a third of the school was lit (or the other way around)...so, on the way to class, around 8:24, the whole school caves. Darkness. For what we hoped was long enough to have us sent home. Fate prevailed over hope, as it usually seems to in the real world, and power was restored twenty minutes later.

The sky is blood red with black clouds. Lightning flashes in the background. Thunder rumbles. What world am I in? Sweat drips down my forehead. My lungs burn. I’m exhausted. I can’t stop to catch my breath. I don’t know what I’m fleeing from. All I know is that it’s evil. I look back. There’s nothing. Why am I running? Fear. Finally my legs give way. I fall to the ground. I crawl forward a couple metres. My hands clasp red dirt as I pull myself forward. Out of the corner of my eye, a blurry specter appears. My mind panics. Who is it? What does it want with me? The ghost takes shape. It wears a black hooded robe, carries a scythe, has skeleton hands and two beady red eyes. Death has come to claim my life. I roll on my back and stare. I try to scream but my throat is dry. “Do you know who I am?” Death’s voice booms. I nod my head. I’ve met him before. My skin crawls. “I’m here to guide you to the land of the dead.” The wraith lifts its blade high in the air. It has to kill my body before my soul can leave the world of the living behind. I don’t want to leave my life, my family, my friends. I grab a handful of rocks. I throw them. Death chuckles at my pitiful attempt. My last glimpse is the scythe’s shiny, silver tip penetrating my chest. Blood splatters everywhere. I shut my eyes. When my eyelids open, I’m standing next to Death, naked. I don’t feel any pain. My chest bears no scars. I’m no longer afraid. I’m curious. What’s happening now? “Follow me,” orders Death. It’s not a scary voice anymore. It’s almost soothing. A James Earl Jones type voice. The earth feels like a sandy beach on my bare feet. “Where to?” I ask. “You’ll find out shortly,” is its reply. I follow. We head towards a black portal. Just before I step into the darkness, I awake in my bed. Blankets drenched in sweat. I feel good though. I take five deep breaths, roll over and fall back asleep. Dying equals death. I’ve heard it’s supposed to be a bad omen to die in your dreams, well your nightmares. I’ve been told that you die in real life shortly after. It’s not true. I’ve been killed numerous times in my dreams and one time I even went out looking to kill Death. I didn’t succeed, but damn was I close. Death beheaded me on an altar that time. I’ve been hit by cars. I’ve been shot. I’ve plummeted to my death. I don’t just wake up at time of impact. I actually leave my body, rise up and look down upon myself. The first time was creepy. The second time wasn’t any better, but now I’m used to it. I don’t know what happens in the afterlife, but I’m getting very curious. It's a new mystery to explore. It's something totally new and exciting. No one can warn you. No one can prepare you for what to expect. Religions try, but there are so many of them. Who is right? Are we reincarnated? Do we become that new baby born in the maternity ward and begin on another life? Heaven? Hell? Do we sail across the sea for eternal life like the elves in Lord of the Rings? Maybe our bodies are unplugged from the Matrix? We’re tossed into the used battery drawer. Whatever it is I hope it’s fun. I hope it’s like Mardi Gras, spring break, the 4th of July all wrapped up as a Christmas present. I'm sure Joel will tell me it's dark, gloomy and not fun. Screw you Joel."

doc01054,1,"Face it, it's real bebeeh! Scientists Find New Face on Back of Turin Shroud By Dominique Vidalon MILAN (Reuters) - Italian scientists have found a matching image of a man's face and possibly his hands on the back of the Turin shroud, believed by many to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, one of the researchers said on Thursday. The discovery that the ghostly image on the back of the linen cloth matches the face that adorns the front is likely to reignite debate over whether the shroud is genuine or a skilful medieval fraud. ""The fact that the image is two-sided makes any forgery difficult,"" Professor Giulio Fanti of the University of Padua told Reuters. The findings of Fanti and Roberto Maggiolo, both from the university's department of mechanical engineering, were published this week by a journal of the Institute of Physics in London. Fanti said the discovery would support those who maintain the cloth is genuine. The shroud, one of Christianity's most sacred but most disputed relics, is a piece of linen some 4.4 meters (14 feet) long and 1.1 meters (3 feet 7 inches) wide. It first appeared in France in the 14th century and has been held in the Italian city of Turin since 1578. For over 600 years the debate has raged over the origin of the image of a tall, bearded man bearing the marks of crucifixion that can be seen on the front of the shroud. Experts over the years say they have found traces of blood, pollen or soil typical of Jerusalem, where Christians believe Jesus was crucified. But 15 years ago three separate laboratories said carbon dating indicated the shroud was no older than the 13th or 14th century. Researchers concluded the shroud was a hoax created for the hugely profitable medieval pilgrimage business. While the front of the shroud has been studied intensively over the years, the back had remained hidden under a piece of Holland cloth which was sewn by nuns to cover up damage caused by a fire. That protective layer was removed in 2002 for restoration and the back of the cloth was photographed. The two scientists said they studied these photographs and used mathematical and optical techniques to process the images. They found that the face that can be seen on the reverse of the shroud matches that of the front. ""We can detect the presence of a nose, eyes, hair, beard and mustache on the back surface that correspond in place, form, position and scale to those of the front,"" Fanti said. Speculation has also grown over who created the image. One theory maintains it was the work of Leonardo da Vinci, who pioneered an early photograph technique and put his own face on the shroud."

doc01059,3,"I received a sermon in my email inbox from John Piper @ urlLink desiringGod.org that deals with the question of making decisions as a church body, needing to take votes, needing 100% unanimity, etc. Sometimes when a decision is made, the congregation can feel left out, put out, or put upon - and our democratic egos get bruised because we not only disgree, but we were also not consulted, and now we don't really have a say in the matter. He is one of my favorite speakers; I love anyone who makes me stop and go hmmmmmm... and this case is no exception. There are changes coming at CWO, and if I'm really on board with what God's doing at the church, what am I to do if I don't agree with the decisions being made? Piper shares an interesting thought in this paragraph: ""I would go to urlLink Philippians 3 . Here Paul would like for them to come to one mind (as he often pleads), but he does not envision an inability to continue working together until that unanimity happens. He says, &#8220;I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. Only let us hold true to what we have attained&#8221; (3:14 -16). This strikes me as amazingly realistic. There are some people who are not yet persuaded. If they took a vote now, there would be differences. But Paul does not talk in either-or terms for the fellowship. He sees process and movement. There is no reason to think the whole church is paralyzed till the minority arrives at agreement. That can even happen after a vote that they disagreed on. "" I have always considered those lines to come from Paul-who-knew-better to those-who-didn't that ""if you don't agree with me, fine - God can show you I'm right"". I'd seen it with a certain amount of arrogance and cockiness, maybe a remnant of his Pharisee days; but also with a confidence that God was showing Him something important right now, take his word for it, ask God to show you the same thing. But the new twist I'm seeing is that Paul is more concerned about moving now in God's purposes, and allowing Him to move in the hearts of others without being held back now. There's a thought in Brian McLaren's urlLink FINDING FAITH that fits here: If I don't agree with something that might in fact be right, I have the option of ""jumping in"" and feeling it out from the inside, rather than just poking holes from the outside about why I think it's wrong. That's a huge leap of faith for me most of the time, probably for most people. But if you trust your leaders, and trust God in leading them - then why shouldn't they be given the benefit of any of my doubts? Why can't I jump in and let God prove that it's wrong? More often than not, I find that my own understanding was limited and wrong, while the vision ahead of the pastor or other leader was in the direction of God's plans for us at the time. Just thinking out loud. Real humility recognizes that God's got something going on, that He's undertaking it and we're just along for the ride, and that with the Spirit's discernment we can join in the effort and stop kicking against the goads."

doc01061,1,"90 years ago all of the arts of the West – visual, literary, and aural - stood up and stared at the state of the world and declared that Man had gone mad. At first admonishing the moral structure of the 20th Century and then declaring that the Modern, schizophrenic man had been born (following the path of Nietzsche and Freud), artists rejoiced in their ability to freshly depict the new mind of humanity. Romanticism, at last, was finally swept away. The new themes: War, construction, science & technology. Politics. Optics. Architecture & design. Destruction. This was all fine and good until the middle of the century; it had, after all, been 40 years. It was time for a little introspection. Artists turned their spectacles inward to study the subtle nuances of language and linguistics (following the path of the Vienna Positivists and the Parisian Scholars) in a new method of exploring and comprehending Man’s - now obviously a constant – state of alienation. Conceptualism was born from this linguistic study, and the lens shifted from contemplating the relationship of culture and the individual into an attempt to define all that art could be, and comprehend, if possible, what art could not be. The first proved difficult, the later somewhat impossible. Artists began to read, and it was fashionable to read along with them, for failure for not having read ( something, anything ) presented the assuredness of not getting it; or, at least, of not being able to pontificate on the subtle references to such-and-such and so-and-so. Artists stopped making stuff and began to show maps, studies, locked galleries…. For artists and their patrons all of this was good. There was interaction, a faith in philosophy, a sense of shared adventure and an exploration into a world uncharted. To boldly go… At first, a few good wars to admonish, later a new modern man to explore. And then a cold war that began to flicker in the background that provided ample light to paint by, and more than enough shadow to slide politically. But how long could anyone listen to anybody express the nuances of linguistic exploration without any physical doing? Art, after all, was as much about looking as thinking. It was time to show the tangible by-products of all these thought-games. The 80s came and with it a new state of hyper-doing was born. The artist moved back into the studio, and began, lo and behold, to make things. And in those 15 seconds, everything spiralled to a halt. The artist, reclining in the studio, writing poetry, practicing that new dance step, editing the next novel, and painting pretty pictures, became an icon; a very wealthy, if not exactly a rich, icon. Artists of every kind retreated to the gallery and the music hall and the publisher they once shunned; the agent and the collector were reborn, the critic re-ignited, and the audience was supposed to show up at openings on Thursday from 6 ‘til 8 for the wine and cheese party. But, alas, the adoring fan of the arts had taken this moment to turn on CNN and watched a new war (the first on closed-circuit TV) and – while catching up on the re-runs - began to wonder how long Cheers really would air for. 90 years after this story began more than several turbine engines collided into steel and concrete. Thank God for CNN this time, for every artist in the West declared that this moment was too close, too emotional, too personal, to even consider as subject matter. Best to leave this one to the media. The arts – all of them - failed with the finesse of a little boy beaten up behind the schoolyard bicycle-rack for his lunch money. The artist retreated to a remote farmer’s field, surrounded by a small group of spectators and a few unsuspecting passers-by. What is to be done? The artist obviously dropped the ball. No blaming the judge here – the finger-work was shoddy, no effort was made to present anything that even resembles a performance; nobody even bothered to tune-up. Artists – all of them - placed last for good reason: they don’t even bother to show up."

doc01064,5,"Not long after the families arrived in Egypt, Herod died. Fear of attack, however, did not go away. Herod’s son Archelaus now ruled in place of his father. Among the mothers and fathers of the children, heated discussions took place. It was agreed that danger still existed. A change in kings would not change the plight of king’s subjects. The Empire and its kingdoms had always outlived its individual rulers. Egypt, however, was not there home. If their children were to one day strike at the foundations of the Empire, fear served only to lock them out of their homeland and its promise. For years their people had lived under the threat of violence. Nothing would change if they never returned. Their journey home would be a gamble based upon a hope. It would be an act of faith. Not long after their return, the people of Nazareth gathered to dedicate themselves to the upbringing of the children. Together they pledged to nurture the children with tenderness and warmth, to model the generosity of sharing, to reveal the beauty of creation, to demonstrate the meaning of care for others, to spur their imaginations with stories, to humor them with play, to equip them with the history of their people, to strengthen them with the customs that enabled survival and resistance. The children became the joy of the people. They grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. The presence of God was in them."
doc01065,6,"Damn... I didn't get stuff on last night either. I was up until 230am, just ran out of time to compress and upload the final product. For Untitled , I pulled a copy off of tape onto my machine -- I'm not sure if it's the right copy because it doesn't have any titles (didn't it have titles at the end?). Unfortunately, when we did the original edit on the iMac in the computer lab it encoded the audio in a format that can't be transferred off of the tape via Firewire. So, I had to capture the video then capture the audio using the line-in of my sound card. Then I had to re-synch the two (since they were captured separately and the audio didn't have any timecode). Finally, I got all of that done. Last step was to de-interlace the footage and letterbox it. I didn't mess with color correcting it or anything because I was running out of time (a few obvious tries didn't look very good). All that remains is to compress the video down to a downloadable format, which is actually happening at home right now. Of course, we'll have to wait until this evening before I can upload it to the website... so check back then. For Blackbird , I captured it. Didn't have any problems (probably because I used my old PC's Firewire instead of an iMac to do the editing). I'll compress it as well and upload this evening. I gotta say, guys, watching the movies made me pretty nostalgic. And I gotta say... we didn't do half-bad. The Blackbird shot is pretty cool (and it's just a rough, first attempt!).

doc01085,4,"The other afternoon I was walking around CD Warehouse and I saw something unusual. They were selling a red Mao t-shirt. I kind of felt a light sickness and laughed a little bit. The idea of a t-shirt with Mao Tse Tung on the front is about as ironic as a Karl Marx lunch box. But that's what Marxism is these days. It's a product. It failed miserably as cultural and economical system years ago. Now it's a prepackaged way to influence people who don't think. Brutal dictators and murderers are pop culture icons and heroes to people who have no idea of their atrocities against mankind. It's kind of funny and sleazy at the same time that the people selling the Mao shirts are exploiting the free market to further communism. Capitalism is far from perfect (like Churchill said, democracy is the worst system of government except for all the other ones), but it incorporates free will. Yes mankind is fallen and freedom is still a very fragile thing. People can become slaves to consumerism but its always within their power to free themselves. Marxism and communism leave no room for free will. A utopian system will never work because man can never be perfect. Anyone who believes that man can live peacefully in an ideal utopian system has a rather naive and childish view of mankind. All forms of government are man-made creations and inherently faulty. That's why free-will is paramount. Yes, free-will allows for exploitation, mankind has the freedom to choose good or evil. Marxism doesn't give mankind the freedom to choose good. Virtue is greater than freedom. As much as we'd like to, though, we can not legislate virtue. Without free-will virtue is not possible. Just because somebody exploits the free market doesn't mean that the free market is inherently evil. It means that the people selling Mao shirts, just as all of us, are fallen."

doc01087,3,"After traipsing the world as the daughter of a Foreign Service officer, I was superficially planted along with my parents and two siblings in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Not sure what I wanted to do – try my hand at becoming the next super model, break into the Ivy League set at Princeton or pretty much nothing, I opted for the later and enrolled in the university in town. My parents lived three minutes from campus, but we all agreed I needed the freedom which living in a dorm afforded. (Now, I know they just wanted me out of the house!) I had one heck of a first year – made a 4.0, fell in love and rebelled in ways I never imagined. It was my second year of school that I met Ginny and Wendy, though I have no recollection of how we began or even transformed into these parts of a whole. It seems we have always been… drawn by our differences, tied by our common core. I think it was my ever-present longing for things beautiful and rare that shone light on the loveliness of Ginny and Wendy: Ginny with her masses of dark curls and the naturally rosiest lips I’ve ever seen. Eyes of curiosity and a mind that reaches beyond my imagination to distant times in the past and future. Goofy and comfortable in her skin. Natural and adventuresome. Accepting and versatile. Laughter. Wendy, a woman from another time, who I’m quite sure was the object of life-changing affection from a medieval knight of the roundtable. Disarming tiger eyes and orange-roped hair. All curves and softness of a Titian masterpiece, and strength and courage of a frontier maiden. Amazing diverse talent and vision. Headstrong and elitist, but unwaveringly loyal. I’ve always thought them simply wonderful and considered myself the lucky one in the group. Ginny was so committed to her study, I relished the opportunity to barge in to her room and keep her from being so productive, plus she had a computer and also a refrigerator that was always stocked with cold Diet Coke. Pink Floyd and Indigo Girls in the background, we spent a lot of time curled on the beds wondering about life and decisions along the way. She particularly hated that I would put my feet on her pillow… There was one moment, so inconsequential that has stayed in my mind. Ginny’s parents had come in for some event. We were on the elevator going up to our floor. Ginny was in a dress – gasp – and looked the most uncomfortable I’ve ever seen anyone look. It irritated me so to see her like that – the ease and comfort I found in her grounded-ness was gone and I hated it. Saturday mornings, Wendy was like a siren calling from the ocean. I would wake up to her singing and the haunting strains of the hammered dulcimer. I loved to float down the hall and watch her. Even amid piles of clothes and yesterday’s school papers layering the floor, she transformed the air into a misty hillside in Ireland. There are so many memories of vibrant living during that time –we were so tentative, but hopeful, believing in each other so much more than in ourselves. We have been changed much by life since then, but still have that same love for each other… the kind that lasts forever."

I don't mean to offend anyone but I've given up pointing out exactly what you point out because no one listens and no one stops saying it. Its not as if I sit there and actually mean the computer is homosexual. Blame it on the society we live in today. Everyone says 'proper good' and 'gay' as general terms now. I really don't think people are out to annoy you. So sorry for saying it but my computer really is the most annoyinly bitch ever. IT NOW TURNS ITSELF ON RANDOMLY. WTF is up with that???? So bad to start to a worse day. I couldn't find half my book sthis morning and paniced. Wooooooooo!

doc01096,3,"If I were to tell you that falling in love brings the best and the worst in you, would you label me as ‘another ordinary, typical, dazed woman’? Perhaps you’ve already been in that state the minute you’ve read the word ‘love’…I mean come on, is it not one of the most ‘hackneyed’ (can be interchangeable with the word ‘corny’) topic you refuse to comment because ‘everybody’ has something to say about it. If I were to tell you that my story is different would you believe me? Of course not! People assumed always that falling in love is something that is ‘universal’ everybody is bound to be in that state at least once in their period of existence. If I were to tell you that you can fall in love for the rest of your life would you believe me? If I were to tell you that it is possible not to have heart aches, rejections, tears, anger, fitting in, indifference would you believe me? Again a resounding NO, am I that ‘lucky’ to know a man that would not give me all of that. If I were to tell you that I could share Him with you would you believe me? Now that would be nice huh? Don’t worry I am in a sound mind and body while writing this and upon making that proposal. You see, love as what they say is complex and it’s true, ever since I have met Him, He brought out the best and the worst in me. One thing that is surprising is that most of my worst became a strength and a motivating factor to improve my self to please Him, to make Him smile. Love’s complexity allowed me to grow in the manner that he would prefer, most of the people I know would say ‘never change for someone’ at this very minute I beg to disagree, I am not ashamed to admit that even if I advocate women’s liberation and individuality among females I have to say that in this instance I would have to lower my flag…my pride in this context is not an issue. And when I say I want to share Him with you I really mean that… I don’t believe in the word luck, I go for the word ‘blessed’. To fall and not be hurt is possible, specially if the one on the other end is GOD."

doc01099,6,"I guess I was around 10 years old when I gave a girl my first love letter. Her name was Latasha B. and for a lil' young kat that was already infatuated with red bones, she was the total package. Cute, pretty & quiet (I tend to be attracted to quiet types). I figure I must have been in maybe the 5th or 6th grade because I definitely wasn't in high school by then. My older cousin Stacy was actually the one that gave it to her. On this particular day, the object of my premature affection happened to be first on the bus. She dropped it off to Tasha then we both went to the back seats and hid. The following moments are ones I will never forget. Shortly after reading a few lines, she began tearing up the paper! To myself I was thinking...""why is she doing that???"" It took so long to write, and it had so many of my innocent pre-teen feelings in it and....WHY IS SHE TEARING IT UP??? :(( My other cousin Freda B. was sitting on her same seat. A combination of curiosity and a desire to have Tasha respect the good intentions of the guy who wrote it helped her read the rest of the letter. It was the first time I ever saw a girl cry! Sigh if only they were only tears of joy.... After my crappy attempt at love was literally destroyed, I began to think of what I did wrong. First, and most importantly, you never say something like ""you so fyne, you fyner than your mama!!"" Instant turn off...I learned the hard way. Much of the letter was like that, and I believe somewhere in that offensive letter was a little boy trying to express his emotions the best way he could...I just couldn't prove it. That's where I learned what was apropriate to tell a woman and what not to. It was the beginning of a long, painful journey, one that for a while, shyed me away from trynna holla at females. Its kinda funny when I think back on it. My thinking was so linear. There was but one purpose in my early going and that was to get the heck outta Calhoun Falls. Prestige, cliques, sports...all that meant nada to me. Well, until senior year. That was a coming out year of sorts. I tried out and made the football team for the first time, even tried out for basketball (didn't make the squad). Made records in track and only got one at bat in baseball. In the end, during my entire elementary & high school career, I never had a true girlfriend. I used to think that was a magnificent drawback but looking back on my short past, every defeat ended up benefiting me in some way later in life. There is a picture being painted and i'm not exactly sure what the final product will be. What I know is that i've had a really non-typical dating life. By the grace of God, i've been thru many situations. I've dealt with pregnant women, needy women, an endless stream of shady women...confronted a sea of personalities head on and in every circumstance, for good or for ill, I came out stronger. It all prepared me for the next adventure in my life. To have and to pursue such a prophecy as was given when I met Nicole...it reminds me of what it takes for prophetic blessings to pass: all parties must be willing. I believe in the power of the works of God in our lives. All my method and general intuition has been led by a power that I cannot fathom. This saying the old people use, about ""if God brings you to it, he'll bring u through it"", it applies unconditionally. If by some stroke of misfortune Nicole and I happen to not fully be able to reconcile our differences, i'm confident that God will bless anyhow. ...and let's be clear on one thing, i'm not looking for a replacement at this time! Love is a serious word with me and I feel in my heart of hearts that the story of Nikki & Ron isn't over yet. There is a book filled with pages that beg to be filled. Even tonite, we've taken some steps to strengthen the friendship. How the future will fare is anyone's guess. Of course i'm a realist (I can be, seriously!) and I realize there's a chance we may never hook back up again. But such is the risk that you take. You have to let people go, experience their own thing. Cause its only by letting something free that you can tell if they truly love you or not. Its kinda backwards tho...cause if anybody needed time, it really wasn't me. I admittedly wasn't prepared at first, what with the well documented obstacles we've dealt with but I got that way. So forgive me if I feel kinda naked. :p I been standing out on this ledge by myself for a minute now... I had some more rants to post but its already 2:43 and i'm sure this stuff needs editing but crap i'll fix it next post or so. *yawn* i'll holla."

I'm kinda busting out of my shirt today - it was fine before I left home but during the day I have popped a button or two at various times. I went out for lunch with Ed at urlLink Yiamass and so am feeling stuffed and the buttons are popping on a more regular basis! I had the seafood spaghetti which had around 100 mussels in it, no word of a lie, a few small shrimp, a couple of tiger prawns and some squid. It was tasty and I managed to only get a little down my front, so I'm quite pleased. Ed has got himself a teaching job in Crawley for a year so he will be staying in Brighton. He's just moved into a flat of his own after spending the year holed up in a student place, so I think he's enjoying having the place to himself. Couldn't believe how expensive it was though - and he's living in Hove, not the centre of Brighton. Hopefully get to visit him down there soon as I'd like to show Graham the place. It's another one on my list of places to live in this country if we stay. Tim lost the tennis big stylee yesterday to the unseeded Croat who is tipped to be the next Pete Sampras.

doc01121,1,"I see Big Fat Fraud has posted a link to an article by the scum bag who wished me dead. [EDIT: After I posted this, Paul disappeared the article from BFB, no doubt to spare himself the criticism for posting to a full-blown bigot] In it, the author goes into his attacks on NAAFA's discussion boards, except he never really tells the truth. You see, he was just a ""skeptic"" and just ""asking questions"" and his mea culpa is acknowledging that its wrong of him to ask questions in a fat acceptance space. All proving he has learned nothing. There is nothing wrong with asking questions about Fat Acceptance. That's an opportunity to teach someone more about what fat acceptance is. And yet, every single troll claims that this is all they were doing. Maybe the first time they posted. The problem is, they want to ask questions, they want to demand a defense of size acceptance, but unless the response is the fat activist repudiating fat acceptance, they aren't interested. This troll's questions were answered, but he never showed any understanding of the answers. He never showed any respect for our opinions. He just kept demanding that we justify ourself to him. And he still doesn't get why that was wrong. He specifically reference me, but naturally in a manner which exaggerates my position and minimizes his abusiveness. He claims in his article that I accused him of a hate crime. This was meant to justify his response, even though he was kinda apologizing for it in the article. Problem is, I never accused him of a hate crime. After this individual specifically attacked me in a thread I hadn't commented on at NAAFA, I said this: ""And again, the trolls resort to making this about individuals who stand up to them. If anyone thinks standing up for size acceptance is on par with the disgusting personal attacks leveled by those who were banned from this board, then they have a serious problem. If anything, I'd say the moderators have been to leniant against the promoters of bigotry. To say that have been ""unfair"" to people who come here with a destructive agenda is a joke."" He acknowledges that he responded with an unprintable remark and claims he immediately back-peddled, but that's not true either. Strictly speaking, he immediately amplified his attack and he only ever back peddled on a wide-ranging insult directed at all fat people. And even while ""back peddling"" he was still blaming it all on me and offering yet another unprintable remark. And this was all long before he wished me dead and started stalking my old blog for months acting like he was somehow my ""buddy"". His article doesn't mention that, either. I guess it'd be a lot tougher to play himself out as the ""good guy"" if it was revealed that over a month after he immediately back peddled that he was still wishing death upon someone who had the gall to disagree with him. He certainly didn't immediately back peddle from his violent fantasies. But he doesn't come clean about any of this in his article either. From the praise being heaped on this bigot at NAAFA, you would think he'd have at least admitted he was wrong in all his petty and spiteful attacks on fat activists. That wouldn't make it all better, but it'd at least be something. But no. He realizes that we were right to call him a bigot, and THAT IS IT. That's a victory for fat acceptance? Getting a bigot to admit he's a bigot? I'm told that I should realize people should change, but what's the change? The fact that he never says it his hate and bigotry was wrong is VERY noticable in its absence. His lack of an apology essentially just affirms his hate's worth. This is something fat acceptance should be happy with? This is someone who is a valued contributor? A bigot and hate monger who knows that we were right to call him a bigot and hate monger? NAAFA's leadership should be ashamed of itself. But, of course, the article's worst offense is that it lumped in an anti-fat hate group founded by one of the worst bigots around as part of fat acceptance. The organization, who picked a name designed to be an insult towards fat acceptance, was founded by one of the Usenet trolls who destroyed Soc.Support.Fat-Acceptance and who spent months attacking NAAFA's site. He joined up with a bunch of diet mongers who were bitter that NAAFA wouldn't abandon fat acceptance at their insistance. Their site has often devolved into petty personal attacks against people in fat acceptance, including death threats/wishes against three fat activists. And don't think I'm taking things personal because I was attacked there. I was a pretty minor target. The death wish directed at me was nothing compared to what was aimed at Jennifer Portnick, who was the subject of a damnation fantasy, or Marilyn Wann, who was hoped to ""do the world a favor"" and eat herself to death. Wann, being far more high profile than myself, was the subject of the worst garbage. Here are some examples. And remember, NO ONE disagreed with any of this... ""shes a raving lunitic."" ""She was one of those bubble butt bimbo bikini brigade."" ""She is an left winged idiot."" ""Someone really should put a muzzle on that rockweiler before she bites an innocent victem."" ""Wann and her cronies have hyjacked the movement in order to sell merchandise and to promote a hate filled agenda of insanity. I feel that Wann is exploiting fat people for profit."" ""For me, there doesnt seem to be something only morally wrong with this, but legally as well."" ""she is about as nuts as they come"" ""Their agenda is to breed fear and to promote fat acceptance by that fear."" ""all she is out to do is have company in her miserable little world that she lives in"" ""An extreme liberal radical ideological rigidity beyond that of the most extremist groups."" ""They have launched smear campaigns on truth and reason at the expense of the health and well being of fat people in order to push their sick religion of fat."" ""I will be attending the next NAAFA convention and I am so embedded they won't suspect a thing. I will bring back so much evidence on this whore of a civil rights org that it will curl your hair."" ""The bottom line is NAAFA's lies are killing people."" ""they have contributed NOTHING to the Size Acceptance Movement."" ""Wann, Portnick, and Bodolay are known liars."" ""These radicals need some serious psycho analysis."" ""NAAFA is not in the civil rights business. They are in the brain washing business."" ""I am a person of peace, but I swear if I were standing infront of this lady, I would have to hit her over the head with the hardcover of her own book!!"" And the real kicker... ""Personal attacks on Blickendorfer, Bodolay, Wann and Portnick are not being made here"" ""What is being said about Maryanne, Marilyn, Jennifer and Conrad are subsequently NOT personal attacks!"" ""I have recently read ""Fat!So?"" by Marilyn Wann and I am not attacking her personally"" (he specifically called Wann delusional) The kind of a discussion you'd find at a fat acceptance site? I should hope not. But NAAFA and BFB continue to validate this hate mongering. The continue to placate their membership and chastize people who have the guts to stand up to it. I keep hoping someone will restore my faith in fat acceptance, but as long as this level of hate is allowed under their ""big tent"", they are telling anyone who believes in fat acceptance to stay the hell out."

doc01123,1,"Today I woke up to the sounds that I was cheating on CB in his dreams. Is he that insecure? Or just that sick? I would never do it; it's not in my fiber. I went downstairs and turned the television on to find that they are completely fucking up Baghdad, does anyone understand how wrong this is? I mean they are just beating them up for the FUN of it, for the FUN of it all, and to get their greedy mitts on their oil. It just makes me so mad how these CNN and these BBC and the Australian networks think I'm that damn stupid that I don't see straight through it. There is nothing that can justify the complete humiliation and destruction these people are facing right now. They want to kill Saddam Hussein, and they think that murder is justifiable. Morons. What makes them better? Tell me? What makes them better people? If Hussein is killing Iraqis, if that makes him a demon, then America is the motherfucking biggest demon of them all. How easily people forget, and then they say, well we had to kill Iraqis back in 1991 to get Hussein out of power, well guess what? He is still there and the whole Gulf War was a waste of fucking time. Bring it on in 2003! Try and kill him this time, and then try to tell us that it won�t be a money making scheme, that it won�t hide the fact that they want to condition the whole damn world to their fucking standards, and that they will stop at nothing to be the center of control. It shows us, the people, that our governing collective are a bunch of uneducated power hungry alienated backwards fucking asshole demons from hell. Bush, Howard, Blair, the triad of the West are dictators, plain and simple, except they are worse, they hide under the pretence that it's a democracy, fuck that. People are just so godamn sick of their propaganda bullshit. Everyone around here is so bummed and so tense. We all had to go to vote for the State elections; I was just disgusted by the blatant half-truths. I was wondering when did normal people go to sleep? When did we become sedated that made the people in power believe that they could pretty much do what the fuck they wanted? Well I never went to sleep and I ignored them and I knew they couldn't believe it. Well believe it, and I'm sorry if I'm being rude but fuck you ok? I already know who I'm voting for and it won't be anyone who is jamming a leaflet in my face. There is going to be a party here tonight, Bri is coming and bringing a small crew, a lot of people are going to be bringing, small armies. We are joining together to escape the guilt of what we are letting happen, well maybe I'm being a little dramatic there, I really don't think even we have a choice. It's going to be pretty funny but my room is going to stay locked because fuck, I just don't want a repeat of what happened last month. Ash everywhere, spilt bong water, chems just getting blown in the wind. I know I'm going to get trashed and I don't care, anything to get my mind of this terrible, awful Iraq beating. I'm glad they are calling it an Invasion because that's just what it is, a complete sadly backwards Invasion. I�m sorry to all the patriots out there, but I fucking hate America. Bri just called and it seems that he is only going to be bringing himself...Let's hope everyone just gets here with lots of drugs so I can forget, completely. But yeah I voted and made sure everyone around me knew that I hated Howard. A complete and utter fool. YOU ARE A FOOL, and if one single Australian civilian or troop has to die for your so-called cause, I will spit at you if I ever have the misfortune to cross your path. God dammit, I hate this! And I have tried to refrain from writing because I am so damn mad! You know I was watching CNN and this buffoon actually said, as he is pointing on a map of Iraq; �For those who understand the geography of this war, this is Iraq� and I�m like, well for one thing, don�t insult my intelligence ok? Firstly, it�s the only country on the map coloured BRIGHT ORANGE, secondly it says IRAQ on it, in big black letters, and thirdly there is a circle near the center of it, which says BAGHDAD.

doc01132,2,"MASSACHUSETTS & MARRIAGE The Supreme Court of Massachusetts set in motion a number of probabilities with their 4-3 urlLink decision Tuesday on the issue of gay marriage. At first glance, it would seem to be a resounding victory for the seven same-sex couples who sued for the right to marry under Massachusetts state law--and it is. But, it is in the ripple effects that this ruling will have in the debate between factions for and against gay marriage--and the bigger issue of acceptance of homosexuality as a country--that the greater victories are to be had. In their decision, the Justice's majority opinion states the following: 01. "" The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry,"" according to the majority opinion. ""We conclude that it may not. "" 02. "" [Denying gay couples the right to marry] is incompatible with the constitutional principles of respect for individual autonomy and equality under law. "" 03. "" Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family -- these are among the most basic of every individual's liberty and due process rights--and central to personal freedom and security is the assurance that the laws will apply equally to persons in similar situations. "" 04. "" Barred access to the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage, a person who enters into an intimate, exclusive union with another of the same sex is arbitrarily deprived of membership in one of our community's most rewarding and cherished institutions. "" While the governor and many political leaders have decried the outcome, the court's ruling does impact Massachusetts in several ways. The state legislature is given six months to rewrite the state's marriage laws for the benefit of gay couples. While it is very likely that a constitutional ammendment will be sought to overturn the ruling, such an effort could not be voted upon by Massachusetts citizens until 2006. Therefore, the legistaure could write law legalizing same-sex marriage or it could do nothing and let the court's ruling go into effect. Outside of Massachusetts there is the likelihood of a Supreme Court challenge to the ruling, as well as continued pressure by President Bush and Congress to limit the definition of marriage to a man and woman. Particularly intersting about the wording of the Massachusetts ruling is the fact that some legal scholars believe the ruling applies strictly to marriage and that creating a separate class of domestic union--such as civil unions--would not be acceptable. This, of course, would differentiate the ruling from the Vermont case that resulted in the adoption of civil unions. MARRIAGE & ME While I've never had a particularly strong opinion one way or the other on the issue of gay marriage, I have always maintained that two people who wish to commit to marriage should have the right to do so. Unfortunately, many times the issue of marriage is so deeply rooted with religious beliefs that it is hard to separate the legal definition--and the rights that come with it--from the idea of the religious definition. I've never understood the argument that same-sex marriage would ""undermine"" the institution of marriage. As each marriage is a separate entity unto itself, I'm not sure I see the logic. If heterosexual couples choose to have an open marriage, commit adultery or divorce--are they undermining the institution and religious law of marriage. If they are, why is no one outraged by this? The fact is that in today's society, the act of sex is separate from the act of marriage. You can no longer fairly argue that marriage is sacrosanct to having children. Whether a person or government chooses to recognize the committment of two loving individuals, you have to make a case that is fair and just for that union to not receive the benefits and protections offered to every other union of heterosexual individuals. In the end, it becomes a question of fairness, dignity and justice. While it is my desire to find a relationship based on a long-term committment, I'm not sure that I personally would ever need the validation of using the word marriage to describe my love and union. Yet, I do see all of the practical issues that same-sex marriage advocates fight for: the right to make medical decisions, the right to military benefits, the right to beneficiary of insurances and retirements, et.al. So many rights that are given simply by virture of engaging in heterosexual union and finding recognition in law. In that respect, the rights of marriage should be afforded to persons of any sexual orientation. Make no doubt that a fight has been won. But, the battle is far from over. ISN'T IT IRONIC? 01. Michael Jackson. Allegations of child molestation. Release date of greatest hits album. 02. George W. Bush in England. Still making speeches that the war in Iraq is ""necessary"" and ""justified"". 03. Paris Hilton. Socialite. Sex video scandal. Fox television show premiere. 04. George Michael.

First thing tomorrow morning, I will be setting it up and hopefully I can have a decent sleep for the first time in a month!! I don't like my job. I'm not really sure why, but it could be due to the fact that I had to spend what savings I had to move and set up here.

Most of the kids I teach are alright and I do enjoy some of my days, but there are alot of days that I just want to stay home and not go to one school or another...and I can't call in sick, cause I just have to do that class again another time. This job sounded great(and I am sure most do before you actually get there) when I was looking for a new job, but honestly, it's not what I thought it would be and has really made me consider a few different options. One is leave this job now and go elsewhere, but I can't because I don't have enough money to. Two is to stay until my contract finishes which is in April and move to a cooler part of Japan or just a cooler country altogether!

I am lucky enough to have a birthday near the scheduled game every year. I remember my first attendance game during my sixth grade year at St. Albert. I had learned of the rivalry earlier in the week when Chris Burke made a full fledged appeal to get fellow classmates to cheer for the green and gold...""my brother is going to play baseball there"" were the winning words that got me on his side. My uncl, Greg, and cousins Chuck (St.X class of '00) and Michael went to the game. I was amazed. So many people. The next year I was fully St. X equipped. I had my St.X baseball cap (which was often mistaken for a Malcolm X hat) and watched the game. Cincy Carrero was a machine and Miguel Montano was quick as lightning. They went on to win the state championship that year. That year was also the year that we lost Sean. He was supposed to meet us at the car after the game. he didn't. We drove around for an hour until we found him by the stables...no wonder he went to Trinity... Eigth grade was the year my football team lost all but one game. Chip Mattingly and Trip Williams were are anchors on defense and Wes Whitworth was hittingn his prime as a reciever. When the toy bowl got postponed we had the greatest week of practice ever...well until Coach Wagner (shamed to say who now coaches the Shamrocks himself) had his son Tony (St.X grad '96) dress in hi sfootball gear. Tony knocked the living snot out of me...before coach could run him off the field he yelled ""that is how it will be next year when he is playing for the Tigers!"" Boy was he right...baseball was my first love, but football was my most challenging sport. Baseball came easy. Football took full concentration. I was and am stil not a big guy. I had to play smart if I wanted to stay alive. I rememeber one time when Bernard Jackson and Joe Jackson hit me as hard as the time Tony hit me in eight grade...only this time I caught and held onto the ball....Coach Johnson about flipped his lid...well he always flipped his lid...but this time he was happy. Well we beat Trinity that fall..in fact we went undefeated and won the city freshman title. Our seniors were not so lucky as I recall. The next three years I cheered from the sidelines...joining in the group cheers. I really enjoyed the big games...everyone cheering for the green and gold.

I can't vouch for the fiction, but there is an article on the Abu Ghraib scandal, a wonderfully balanced article on John Kerry's career as a lawyer and a real human (as opposed to the reformed coke head bible beater with no original thought in his fucking head that is currently the leader of the free world), and a great review of Bob Woodward's new book Plan of Attack (For those of you who don't know, Woodward is one of the most important journalists of the last 50 years and one of the last truly objective voices). According to the review, the writing isn't great but the facts are laid bare for interpretation. Both candidates are recommending people to read it. Some of the quotes are scary. Read the article. Colin Powell is one unhappy man. ON MY CRAIGSLIST POST FOR FISHING PALS I got one hit already from a guy who is a journalist for the Dow Jones. He wants to go fishing up at Liberty State Park, across from the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Isle. We might write something about it. He doesn't seem like he fishes much, in fact I'm supplying the rods. We'll see what happens. OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK I've finally read the writings I've been meaning to. Mark Mandell's short ""Newton's Apple"" gave a real sense of what it must be like to be least insane person in an asylum. The idea of struggling for something so intrinsic in our day to day lives is very cool. And the lure to let it go... Some things I'd change, but Mark has a book and I don't. DW has sent me ten pages of something. There is more emotion in some of these sentences than I've been able feel about anything in the past year. There's no third person distance. You have your face pressed into these words. Always something trivial to clean up, some focus narrowed, but this guy is doing something worthwhile. I promise. If anyone wants to read anything from these two, let me know and I'll ask them if I can send anything."

doc01151,2,"Laurie I read your post and it brought me to tears.. Not exactly a solution, but I want you to know that the heart of the Lord is broken for you and for so many because we have strayed so far from the most basic definition of Christian living.. ""See how they love one another!"" I hear your heart to be in real community.. a people on a journey, and committed to one another and to being the church together.. a community of life, light and love and in that light a witness to the darkness around them. The modern church is really all but incapable of such a thing. And so there are many of us.. you would probably be surprised just how many... beginning to build something new. It is about making a new start.. and not merely new paint for the old thing. No one puts new wine into old skins... So my encouragement to you.. and my prayer for you.. is to find just a few others who are trying to be the church for one another.. and then in that growing strength to begin to reach out with that love. One hand reaching in.. and one hand reaching out. It's hard to make that new beginning. Why? Because we have all died trying to renew the old thing.. and now we have less faith and less strength for a new venture. And even rebuilding means some simple structures.. and we have no faith in structures. So it takes a kind of leap of faith into newness. ANd maybe that leap is truly a faith leap... a divine spark and a gift from above. And, as you point out.. you can't make that leap alone. The leap is made relationally not only individually. So the divine gift is first a gift of community. So Lord of the church, connect Laurie with the few who are going to new places."

""If this was all I the drama I dealt with, life would be so easy."" Of course that is a lie...this is perfect because I can recharge my battery for it over the school year. I haven't talked to my mom or my grandparents or friends that have called really since I got here. I knew that is how it would be...it's not that I don't care, it's just that my time on the job coencides with their time off work, and when I get off work, I want to sleep, not make phone calls. I look like an ass to them all, and I don't like that. David got my files back! So now I sit with my Barnes & Noble impulse buys, feeling good but realizing how much money I dropped. The girl at Barnes & Noble was quite attractive...jet black cropped hair, nose ring, pink tank top with chinese zodiac symbol...but she was an all business worker. I dropped $25 on a Readers Advantage card because she mentioned that it would make my prices cheaper, but what it did was add $15 to my total price. So if I drop $150 more at B&N (possible), I'll make back the money. She told me why it was, and had very short conversation with me, and I think she was a bit interested in a slightly more than pedestrian way (and if you can get a hot girl who works in service to show interest in you, it's quite the accomplishment). But her demeanor was all professional...she was interested in making Barnes & Noble money. That's cool, but not attractive to me. Be kind of flimsy, be a rebel a bit...but then you're giving up power, and when you have to fight to be considered for more than your body, any loss of power will require great lengths to get it back. Maybe I'll see her when I return the books tomorrow. I'm taking two back...I bought them with that Amazon gift certificate that never got used because Amazon duped me. They came in handy here, where I was able to save $35 by buying through them rather than Barnes & Noble. They'll be sent to Duke, where I start on Monday. I won't have the other three finished by then. Wow, I will really miss these kids come Saturday. I never had a little brother or sister. I see Daniel Young interact so well with his sister Laura and brother David, and try to be a good influence on them, and I just wish I had someone I could do that with, show the ropes to and try to help out of sticky situations like my sister did with me towards the end of our high school careers. I've got 35 right now, most of whom I have a good or great rapport with. And Chris had it right, we won't know each other again come Saturday. Sure, I'll see one or two maybe...maybe one will end up at another TIP camp (this will become a regular summer thing for me, no doubt), maybe someone will need a recommendation letter, and there will be awkward emails and IMs and the like, but this is it for living a life like this, where we know each other as well as we do.

Who knows, maybe it will be good for me? I arrived in Philly August 8, 2004. After a wonderful day of moving in and being completely exhausted and slightly sick from eating something which did not agree with me that weekend I was officially in the city. Last week was orientation. Last week was fun. Last week went way too fast. I really like my class because there is such a variety of people represented. Black, white, asian, indian, christian, jew, islamic, atheist...you name it I am sure someone of your description goes here. And another interesting thing is that a lot of people are either engaged or married trying the whole med school thing. I'm really glad my social attachments do not involve anything remotely romantic right now. Anywho, I'm writing this at the end of my 2nd day as a MSI (med student). And how do I feel? Rather relaxed to be honest. The key is keeping up with the material each day. That requires about 3 to 4 hours of study once you get home from classes which normally run 8-4/5 each day. A typical day for me involves lectures beginning at 8 and normally going through 11 or 12. At that point, at least in this trimester, we all heard up to the anatomy lab and dissect our cadavers for 2 to 3 hours at a time. Being only the second day, I am still getting used to gross. Our lady, Ruby, is a large black lady who graciously donated her body for the sake of society hopefully receiving compentent doctors in 4 years. There is nothing more surreal than looking at the shell of a person, and then violating that shell in order to learn all you can about whatever section of the body you are on (right now it's the dorsum). I really don't want to make this an extremely long entry because I will write again and touch on other things...but real quick; found a great church about 20 minutes away on Sunday, very young, very contemporary, nondenominational. I'll probably check it out again this Sunday. God got me to this point in my life and I know He will carry me through this stage as well. Ok, bed time-I'm trying to be ambitious and will be getting up before lecture tomorrow for a bike ride...God Bless."

""Yes"" be ""Aye"" ""No"" be ""Nay"" ""You"" are certainly ""Thou"" ""You would"" or ""You should"" rolls best off the pecking tongue as ""Thou would'st"" or ""Thou should'st"".

Address people by rank, title, occupation or physical description. ""My Lord"", ""My Lady"", ""Good Shire"", ""Good Wife"", ""Lad"" or ""Lass"", ""Lusty Bar Maid"", ""Fearless Knight"", ""Juggler"", ""Silly Clown"", ""old Sailor"", etc. Unlike contemporary society. the Elizabethan's had a socially stratified society. They were constantly aware of their social standing and the social standing of those around them. From necessity, addressing people was nearly an art form. In order to feel comfortable at Faire, you will need to have an insight to their social level and yours (the character you deem to be for the day). Fortunately, Faire people wear clothing in accordance with their social standing. The addresses used are based on a combination of social standing and familiarity. Ergo, the Earl of `Rycrofft could call the ""Earl of Worth"", ""Worth"", ""My Lord cousin"", etc. But a merchant or peasant would call both men ""Lord"", or ""My Lord"", or ""My Lord, Earl"". ""Sir"" or ""Mistress"" be always a safe wager for a personage that is not nobility, but so well dressed as to signify upper class. To nobility ""my Lord"" or ""my Lady"" is safe if you don't know their name or exact title. The Queen is referred to as ""Your Highness"", or ""Your Grace''. In the third person, the Queen may be called ""Her Highness. Dukes and Duchesses may also be addressed as ""Your Grace"". Office holders such as Judges, Constables, or Bureaucrats, Knights and Squires may be called ""Your Honour"". And there you go. We've got to talk like this Monday. Should be fun,fun!!!"
doc01160,1,"I Still Love Belle de Jour ...despite the emails to her claiming opinions to the contrary. Flipping idiots. She's a whore, not your weekly sitcom. Not an homage, but a snippet from said urlLink heroine of mine . Posted without expressed written consent, so don't bloody tell her. Last night when I checked email, Hotmail offered a link to 'Dating Tips from the Animal Kingdom'. Expecting the piece to delight and entertain was about as fruitful as reading the back of a shampoo bottle in search of fine literature, so I offer instead an alternative list of dating tips from the animal kingdom. 1. Our good friends and co-evolutionaries Canis familiaris (the domestic dog) show that when in doubt which hole to aim for, thrust wildly. You are bound to land in something good. 2. Shrimps' hearts are in their heads. Men have neither hearts nor heads. 3. The tongue of a giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is half a metre in length, long enough to clean its own ears. If you can do the same there may be a career option you had not yet considered... 4. Dolphins engage in group sex. If those squeaky grey-skinned fisheaters can do it, so can you. 5. The females of the bonobo species (Pan paniscus), closely related to humans, are known to use sexual favours to gain status and food. A point to remember next time you're short of change at the corner shop. 6. Some ribbon worms will eat themselves if they can�t find food. Unfortunately, men unable to find sex are rarely so talented. 7. The anal glands of cats, genus Felis, are used to mark their territory and identify themselves to other cats. Whether this explanation will convince the hotel not to charge you for excess laundering is questionable. 8. The sailfish, the swordfish and the mako shark can all swim at a speed of over 50 miles per hour. If you meet someone unpleasant at a club it's unlikely you'll be able to escape as quickly. 9. Lions have been known to mate over 50 times a day. This is probably the sole criterion to become King of the Jungle. 10. A rhinoceros's horn is made of hair. Men who are lacking in the horn department, on the other hand, are not advised to grow ponytails to compensate for the fact. 11. Human birth control pills work on gorillas. If you have more success finding contraceptives and a female gorilla than a mate, something has gone horribly wrong. 12. Time is limited and some opportunities may never repeat themselves. Take a tip from swallows of the genus Hirundo, who mate in midair, regardless of the number of people on the flight. As an aside, whilst researching this entry I ran across a site of dolphin dildoes. By which I do not mean dildoes shaped like dolphins. I mean dildoes the size and shape of a dolphin's member. Eep."

doc01162,3,"Concerned for the Future By Sandy Escobedo January 10, 2004, 1:19am New York, NY As I sit here and read through endless articles on Latino experiences coming particularly from those who are from LA, I can’t help but wonder, how “Latino” are my kids going to be? I ask myself this because I am presently coping with the confusion one encounters when your passport reads “U.S. Citizen”, your parents are immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, and you were born and raised in SOUTH EAST-LA, a part of LA that isn’t acknowledged enough. Becoming cognizant of our multiple identities is both a blessing and a curse. It is the complexity of our identity that makes us more interesting individuals, but it is that same complexity that makes it difficult for others to decipher who we are. And when I say others, I mean everyone, especially we as “Latinos.” Like many “enlightened” Latinos, I had the privilege of receiving a college education. I recently graduated from UCSB with a degree in Art History and two minors in French and History. Because of my major, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Bordeaux France for a year and intern at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It is through these experiences as well as the course work I took that I formulated ideas on who I was. I took a Chicano Studies class and found myself wondering whether I was a Chicana or not. I sometimes I felt obligated to consider myself Chicana because I knew the flaws associated with the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino.” Honestly though, I felt more comfortable, and in some way prefer the term Latino over Chicano. My reasons are entirely personal and in no way would I want to impose my preferences and biases on others. I don’t consider myself Chicana because I don’t relate to what I SEE associated with Chicanismo. I see Chicanismo, in context to LA, as associated with second or third generation Mexicans that were once from EAST LA who don’t speak Spanish and are too distant from being “Mexican.” First and foremost, the immigration experience of my parents is recent and it is different from the families of self-proclaimed Chicanos. My parents came to the U.S. in 1979; my dad from Mexico fleeing poverty, my mother from El Salvador fleeing the beginnings of the civil war. My parents never worked in a field. In fact, I had never seen farm labor until I encountered it on the 101 ventura freeway on my way to UCSB. My parents instead began their life here in the service sector and now work in unionized jobs in which my dad earns a middle-class salary by working 12 hour shifts, at times, 7 days a week. In other words, my parents are an example of meritocracy. However, I understand that my parents have lucked out; they don’t. They view that our success is attributed to all our hard work or as they would say “Bendiciones de Dios.” What they fail to see is that not every one with their background will achieve the so-called American Dream. And because of this, my father nags at me all the time because I should be proud and not ashamed of being born in this country. Thinking that I know it all, I just comfort myself by seeing him as a concerned parent. Then I think about the future, and my own kids. For me, it is a must that my children speak Spanish. It is a must that my children are advocates for social justice. And most importantly, it is a must that they recognize that their socio-economic privilege is the result of their grand-parents “illegally” crossing the border to hustle in this country in give me a chance to reach my full potential. And I fear that not happening and I fear viewing myself as a bad parent as a result of it. But at the same time, is it fair for me to burden my children with such expectations knowing that they will be inevitably distant from my paisa experience no matter how much I try to imbed them in it?"

doc01165,2,"The great philosopher and mid-'80s stand-up comedian Emo Phillips once said, ""Why hate other people because of their race when there are so many GOOD reasons to hate others?"" Like most good comedy, there is something profound about this statement that gives one pause. This was about the only great thing Emo Phillips ever said before he disappeared, but one really good thought per career or lifetime is better than most people manage. I've had reason of late to consider those words and the subject of hate. I will not go into great detail about who I've met who said what about whom when I was at the grocery store, the mall, the gas station, the drive-thru, the bookstore, the university, et cetera, ad infinitum, ad nauseum. Hate is common, pervasive, casual and always justified by something. If it isn't some clerk commenting out of the side of his mouth about ""a member of our town's Hispanic community"" who can't find the ketchup, it's a cop blithely using the term ""Counciltucky"" (a firing offense in my opinion) to describe all the ""white trash"" in his district or it could be an otherwise upstanding member of our city's professional ""class"" ranting about how unlike ""us"" Arabs are. I call B.S. on all of that. You can dress it up however you want. You can make it a joke, call it your opinion or claim it is the well-considered fruit of your greater geopolitical knowledge, but hate is hate. The problem is not WHO you hate, it is THAT you hate. Don't believe me? Ask God. I am not a very religious man. I make no apologies for remaining unaffiliated although I did dabble briefly in Catholicism around the false millennium of 2000. I have always believed religion and spirituality were two issues that intersected. Combine the fact that I would be afraid to pick the ""wrong"" religion, denomination, sect or cult with the fact that I am more or less agnostic and you get a pretty clear picture of where I stand on religion and why. But the vast majority of mankind is affiliated with one religion or another. at least they claim to believe in God. Not just A God, but THE God, the SAME God - granted with slightly different prophets, messages, powers inclinations and chosen people, but basically the same God. I've seen very few religions outside of ""Conan"" novels that did not promote love and peace as virtues. Likewise, I've seen very few religions escape the inevitable twisting of God's words to justify hate. Love your neighbor. Love your enemy. It's pretty straight forward and universal. Yet, I've seen few religions that did not have those hangers-on who could take decent philosophies and twist them for their own agendas. This should just help illustrate how universal much of the human experience is. Most people know enough to be ashamed of their hate, which is why they dress it up or hide it. There is something to be said in favor of blatant racists. At least they aren't hiding anything. When a guy is shouting epithets and slandering entire groups of people loudly and proudly, he shows the world how ugly and ignorant he is allowing them the opportunity to avoid him. In my experience, the best cure for racism is exposure. As much as students and faculty complained about Iowa State being so terribly, terribly white (another subtle form of ""legitimized"" racism I call ""OK to hate white folks""), it was a great place to meet people from all over the world and I'm glad I did. Really getting to know people from different countries makes two things obvious to you. One is that the vast majority of mankind is made up of absolute sweethearts. It's true. I can go through an entire list of the people I've met from different countries of different races who subscribed to different religions who were so kind, considerate and all-around good they made me weep thinking about what a bad person I am. Koreans, Malaysians, Africans, Arabs, Jews, Indians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, Colombians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Japanese, Irishmen, Belgians, English, Germans, Hungarians, Australians, Canadians and even Frenchmen have all crossed my path and impressed me with something they should never have needed to prove to me - their humanity. People are good and the only way to know that is to go out and meet them because it is harder than hell to hate a whole group of people once you get to few of them. With that said, you cannot teach diversity in the schools. Diversity cannot be learned, it has to be experienced and trying to teach people how they should feel and act toward others is futile and ultimately does more harm than good. Meet people, learn about them, hang out, do whatever it takes to really get to know them and you will find it impossible to hate them just for their race. Like Emo said, race is ultimately one of the lamest reasons to hate others. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

doc01169,2,"urlLink Every morning I wake up - not to the twittering of birds but the grizzly sounds of motors. Sounds that sound like a witch's wail, like wind caught up in a valley. I do not blame them. Eh! Them...the poor construction workers who are slogging their butts off in this heat nor the company that supports the millions that they hire. After all there will be a shiny new building and lots of people will have nice rooms to live in. Now that I have put my most sucrose foot forward - hand me the friggin ear muffs! At the rate at which they are digging - they will hit oil - and I shall be drenched in the grease. Ode to the Oil Dig away Bob the Builder thou shalt ruin every morn with thy gut wrenching howl thou shalt unearth the heart of the earth by thy gutter-goo gutter-goo in my imagination I shalt think of it as the pigeon that did the doo in my balcony sill Someday! Someday! I shall wake up ....to Norah Jones's sunrise sunrise....and the sweet smell of jasmine, sparrows shall chirp and I will step out into green grass and squint my eyes to see the day leaking out of the clouds and swamping my world with a warm fuzzy feeling.

doc01170,3,"Well, I went to see it last night. Was it the perfect movie in so much as it covered both sides in a fair manner? No. However, what the movie did bring up and the idea that if even 10% of it is true- then my God, things are a zillion times worse than I thought they were. There were parts of the movie that were so moving that I actually cried in a profound, tears streaming down my face sort of way. I think seeing the footage of war - the real nitty gritty- our troops being burnt to a crisp and then hit with baseball bats has changed me for life. I support our troops, I do not support this war and there is a profound difference in that. The points that Moore makes about how the poor of this country are the first to go over and defend us (recruiters preying on poor neighborhoods for militia men) hit me as one of the most horrible things we as a nation allow. Watching families lose their sons, for oil sickens me. I don't know if John Kerry is the best answer to lead America, what I do know is that the current administration must be removed. We as Americans have a responsbility to elect someone who can restore our credibility to the world. Perhaps I am naieve, too left, a flower child- perhaps living with a Hippie uncle has slanted me- I am Catholic, and pro-life but I can not allow myself to be a single issue voter. The footage of our troops in Iraq has changed my life. I realize that there is another side to the efforts over there, that there are Iraquis who support us and we are building schools, and expanding the country in a ""democratic"" way- but at what cost? Our own profits... our own greed...is the American way the only way to live? We choose our country but I don't know if we should be thrusting our way of life onto other nations... I don't know if we necessarily have it all right -the moral decay, the violence, the lack of family values- I don't know if we are the perfect way to live. I feel more and more like our quest to bring ""democracy to the world"" is more like a Crusade...everyone has the choice of how they want to live their life- our arrogance scares me, I am asking all of you to go see this film- take the time to think about these issues. Our generation is going to be left with many things to tackle and we as a well educated group of women has a responsibility to have an opinion and work for a better world. We have been given so much- of who much is given, much is expected. Vote. Read. Have debates. Remember what it is to be American, but remember that in the scheme of the world, we are a young nation and perhaps there are things that when we step away from it all we can learn from- remember what we looked like before Vietnam and the 60s... remember how one event can change the course of a nation's history. Ok, I am done- I have spouted off for entirely too long and the American Studies major in me can't help herself... but I wanted to share these thoughts with you, since right now I am longing for an academic environment where topics like these can be challenged... See this movie. When you walk out you may hate it or love it but you should see it either way because it makes you think, and how often these days does entertainment do that?"

doc01174,6,"Hello my dearest friends, family, and Ben. I agree completely with Beej's last post. Comment, you fools! The button is there for a reason! But, alas, if I were to have a post as short as this, then it would be a true first. I think I've finally come to accept my place as the one who talks too much. Wow, now I almost wish I had something to say. I have a problem...an indecision if you will. South Carolina is calling my name, and it's only a matter of time before I'm asked to pack up my things (which, ironically enough, I just finished unpacking last night) I'm not even entirely sure I've told Ben yet, nor have I told many people at all, excluding Sara/Cera, Rosalie and a few others. But, do I really want to leave? That, my friends, is another question entirely...one which I'm not sure I know the answer to. Along with that, what if it's just another scare like last time? This time last year I was tearing my hair out wondering whether or not I'd be moving to North Carolina. But, then again, David and Mom weren't engaged, he didn't have a job oppurtunity waiting for him that can be taken as early as two weeks, and every other little factor that has served to contribute to this awkwardly silent massteria raging inside of my mildly insane little head. Oh well, I suppose the best I can do right now is go on like I always do, making it from day to day without exploding. That is the best I can do, right?"

His computer is running Windows ME and is laced with Spyware (this is the computer he doesn't use). Anyways he wanted me to help him install his cable modem which won't install properly. This entire thing was a catch-22. To install the cable modem, you have to defeat the mongol like hordes of spyware, but in the process the computer freezes over and then you have to restart the whole thing over. Deleting the registry/source of the spyware doesn't help cause the computer freezes during that process too. This whole thing was such a pain in the neck.

That might be considered...oh...extremely insensitive. Of course, in all seriousness, Sheybani would have really prescribed Paxil or Zoloft rather than Prozac."
doc01179,6,"For most modern evangelical Christians, good Biblical exegesis is nothing more than 1) getting at the ""moral"" of the story (i.e. don't lie) or 2) identifying with the Biblical character (""how does this make you feel?""). Historical Biblical exegesis has centered on the story, looking at the beauty of the narrative unfolding from Genesis through Acts, and attempting to see what God is doing at any given point by revealing His Christ. Moderns in the grip of the sin of individualism have a hard time seeing the larger story, something greater than themselves. Now consider modern pop culture, specifically pop music. Why does our culture lack so desperately for great story tellers? Pop music is nothing but an endless stream of broken romances, angsty feelings, or trite love-ditties. Hollywood Country musicians still tell stories, but they are usually hollow and moralistic, teaching us that patriotism is a fine sentiment, or what goes around comes around. And the contemporary Christian offering seems to mimic the rest of it, replacing the angst and despair with sentimental and romantic goo. What's interesting to me is that this didn't seem to be the case a generation ago. Pop musicians knew how to tell stories. Simon and Garfunkel, while being thoroughly modern and humanistic, told gripping stories in their songs. Country stars like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard made a living off it, telling us stories of low-lives and jailbirds. And my favorite writer of the era, Robert Hunter (primarily with the Grateful Dead) came up with all kinds of colorful characters, set throughout American history. Perhaps the fundamental humanism and despair of the storytellers of the 60's led to our modern introspection, but I like to think that our individualistic exegesis must have contributed as well. Or perhaps our individualism has driven both our exegesis and our storytelling."
doc01180,2,"I'm a cheater. I cheated. Ever since I started working for urlLink Clarins Paris in August 2002 (I quit there to work for the Board of Trade in last January and that was the best decision I ever made, but that's another story), I have been using Clarins products, which are very high quality. It was easy, since I could get them for much cheaper and sometimes for free. But now I don't work for Clarins anymore and I'm starting to run out of some products. I can still order Clarins products for cheaper than they are in stores, through friends that I made that still work at Clarins, but it makes me feel bad for using them for that. So this week I cheated: I went out and bought some urlLink Biotherm products. Because they're much cheaper than Clarins, but they're also very cool products, much fresher, much younger (as in the concept) and more attractive to me. I even became a real customer , by choosing to buy my products in the store that had the gift with purchase! And in that gift with purchase (a cosmetics pouch with a couple of product samples), there was a sample of Source Thérapie, which I just tried on. OH. MY. GOD. I think I'll become even more of a customer and go buy it. The Source Thérapie promise: Pure SPA Concentrate Skin Perfector A spa-blue, silky gel texture for an incredibly soft and velvety-smooth skin. Source Therapie is a skin perfector which acts on the skin in 2 stages: - an instant perfecting effect. After 5 seconds, skin is incredibly soft and the complexion more even. - a long-lasting perfecting effect. After 5 days, skin is perfected, ideally moisturized, soothed and glowing with health. And hell, it does feel like you're applying silk on your face! Of course, the sample is too small to see if the 5-day promise comes true. And so you have to buy the product to see. I'm seriously considering it. Just thought I'd share my discovery with the shopaholics out there (I'm sure there are some!). And too bad for Clarins. They're too expensive and too high class. Biotherm suits me better, 'cause I'm young and cool."

doc01184,2,"Philadelphia Wasteland My mom now has Internet. After providing her 1 hour and 15 minutes of tech support (and I don't have AOL or Windows), she has it up and running. Until she breaks it again. I spent the day building bookshelves and staining, so the fumes have gotten to me. This should be a fun post. The other day I was walking by the Gallery along Market Street expecting to still see Disney Hole - the thankfully failed venture - only to see a parking lot. (For lots of info on DisneyQuest, visit urlLink City Paper and type it into the search function.) This parking lot is more disappointing than the giant 1-block hole and DisneyQuest combined. A parking lot. ""Yeah,"" some idiots say. More parking in Philly. ""Blah,"" others say, ""Another drab parking lot."" ""How fucking stupid,"" I and others are saying. What a waste. It brings in little revenue during the Gallery's open-to-close hours and from some surrounding offices - when compared to what a building with business could generate. It's a black 1-block expanse that will add to the stifling heat of the summer. I had an idea for Disney Hole way back when, but I never said anything about. Go activism! But it was the important people of Philly who decided it should go back to a parking lot. It won't help Philly; I won't be helping City Council when they run for election again. Here was my vision: A megaplex of stuff to do in Philly after the city dies each day at 7 p.m. What does Center City currently lack? The list might be shorter to name what they do have, but just a few: 1) a major theater (the ghetto theater is long gone). It's either University City, 69th Street or way down Delaware Avenue to Tasker Street. 2) recreational activities aside from drinking, 420 and criminal mischief. What could have filled Disney Void is a lower level roller skating rink (plenty of people do this, or would if it were available) or a bowling alley (plenty people do this or would if it were available). Above that would sit a major-run movie theater with stadium seating and all that goes with it. Also, along this row could be additional shops and offices (the site is big enough). Notice I did not mention a parking lot anywhere. Why? Because the site doesn't need one, even with all of the extra people this would draw. Just to refresh important people's and others' minds and inform out-of-towners: The Gallery is a major transit hub. The El makes 5 (FIVE) stops in this part of town. The Broad-Ridge Spur (subway) stops here. All 5 (FIVE) of the trolley lines stop in this area. PATCO - subway/train to New Jersey - stops here. NJ Transit buses stop here. SEPTA buses stop here as do all 7 (SEVEN) regional rail lines. What's the need for parking?? There isn't. And Monday through Thursday, I'm sure most of the surrounding parking lots sit half empty after dark, so car drivers could use them. And this venture, appropriately named Swope Square, Center or whatever, would bring x times more revenue into the city's pockets than the parking lot ever will or ever could. How many people do you know who flock to a spot because there is something to do during the day and night? How many people do you know who flock to a new parking lot? What the lot is doing is alleviating - in a minuscule way - the parking crunch, which encourages more cars, more exhaust and less use of public transit. So you have beef with public transit? Increased use, means more money for SEPTA, PATCO and NJ Transit, which gives them more money for improvements. Rather than a downward spiral, it's upward. And of course, Philly would offer more to do to attract people from the burbs and retain those who live in the city."

And that sucks so much. People like my brother and my husband could be drafted to fight a battle they want no part of. I've never believed there was a reason for going over there. Now that we are there and have messed everything up, there's no way we can consciably leave. So we have to keep sending fodder over there for the snipers and guerrillas to hunt. And with a draft, that fodder could end up being my husband or brother, or if this resolution is passed, it could be me. Not to mention, are they going to make allowances in this proposal for what could happen? What is done if a husband and wife are both drafted? Will one get to stay home with the kids? Which one? Do the parents get to decide, or will the government step in according to the ""special skills"" mentioned later in the article? I almost hope they try to draft me. I would love to burn my draft card or move to France. I've already got one cousin over there. There is no way I or the rest of my family is going over there.

""There are some serious unanswered questions,"" says Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon is stalling on several investigations, and congressional inquiries have ground to a halt. The foot-dragging is astonishing, given that Congress has access to classified documents detailing the abuses outlined by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in his report on Abu Ghraib. Rolling Stone obtained those files in June and offers this report on their contents. The new classified military documents offer a chilling picture of what happened at Abu Ghraib - including detailed reports that U.S. troops and translators sodomized and raped Iraqi prisoners. The secret files - 106 ""annexes"" that the Defense Department withheld from the Taguba report last spring - include nearly 6,000 pages of internal Army memos and e-mails, reports on prison riots and escapes, and sworn statements by soldiers, officers, private contractors and detainees. The files depict a prison in complete chaos. Prisoners were fed bug-infested food and forced to live in squalid conditions; detainees and U.S. soldiers alike were killed and wounded in nightly mortar attacks; and loyalists of Saddam Hussein served as guards in the facility, apparently smuggling weapons to prisoners inside.' read the rest of the article urlLink here . i'd warn you in advance about the graphic content, but it should hardly surprise anyone at this point."

doc01197,2,"Report: Bush taking drugs to combat stress No, this isn't some old news about Bush's numerous alleged substance trysts. This is urlLink in the now : The prescription drugs, administered by Col. Richard J. Tubb, the White House physician, can impair the President’s mental faculties and decrease both his physical capabilities and his ability to respond to a crisis, administration aides admit privately. “It’s a double-edged sword,” says one aide. “We can’t have him flying off the handle at the slightest provocation but we also need a President who is alert mentally.” Presidential protocol calls for all medical prescriptions to remain private. And thus the speculation begins. In an unintentionally hilarious development, the breaking point had to do with Kenny Boy! Tubb prescribed the anti-depressants after a clearly-upset Bush stormed off stage on July 8, refusing to answer reporters' questions about his relationship with indicted Enron executive Kenneth J. Lay. “Keep those motherfuckers away from me,” he screamed at an aide backstage. “If you can’t, I’ll find someone who can.” Supposedly, Adolf Hitler had his aides injected him with methamphetamines several times a day during the crumbling of the Third Reich. If you know anything about meth, you know that it makes you really PARANOID (or, at the very least, wide awake). So that was probably a bad idea. Disclaimer! I'm not at all implying that Bush is on crystal meth, just that he evidently shares many of the traits that Hitler displayed as World War II slipped out of his outstretched hand. The article doesn't mention the Hitler connection, but does compare Bush's behavior to the late-term antics of Nixon (talking to presidential portraits) and Reagan (early-onset Alzheimer's). As a human being, I feel bad for Bush. He's been dealt the addiction card and has played it more times in his life than has been good for him. Over time, he's cleaned up and allegedly relapsed numerous times. This bodes badly for him as a leader. If he handles the presidency this badly, then maybe we should seriously reconsider his position, for health reasons if nothing else. Then we could symbolically hand over the reins to Dick Cheney, whose health is...ah, forget it... Read more about our fearless leader urlLink here"

doc01199,1,"Strange, strange day. Caricatures Today. Nice day. About 70 degrees, cool breeze, partly cloudy. Set up at about 12:00. Usual spot. But the people that are usually to my right weren't there. They had to move across the aisle. Next to me is a giant (10ft x 5ft) swinging display of bumper sticker designs. Good thing is, it opens up a lot of space for people to stand behind me to watch the caricatures. Bad thing is, I can tell this is going to be a strange day. I get everything set and decide to start the day with some samples. I wanted to see if I could start getting customers in sooner. There's this large roley-poley chubby kid that hangs around my booth every week. His parents run a booth somewhere in the venue. He's always hanging around asking for a free drawing. Today I offer it to him. I explain that it will be a sample that I'll use for display and I will give him a free Xerox copy tomorrow. Kid agrees. While I'm drawing kids Dad comes over to make sure he's not gonna have to pay for something. I explain that it's a sample, I'll give him a copy, blah, blah, blah. Dad laughs, he thinks it looks just like him. He walks away seemingly happy. I finish and give it to kid to show the 'rents... doesn't come back. Demo worked, I get lots of customers lined up and start into it. Business slows down an hour or so later and I go track down caricature sample from roleypoley kid. He gives it back and I tell him I'll have a copy for him tomorrow. Kids mom comes over a few minutes later, says Dad doesn't want someone having picture of his kid for sample. ""What?"" I say. She repeats herself. ""Whatever"" I say. She elaborates, it's because lots of people know their kid and they don't want someone having a picture of him. ""Whatever"" again. So I tell her I'll take drawing out of sample stack. She leaves. Dad comes back a few minutes later and says he wants to see me tear it up in front of him. ""Um.. no!"" Dad gets pissy, says they are Mexican and Mexicans are superstitious about people having pictures of their kids. Voodoo curses and crap like that. ""whatever."" I know lots of Hispanics and very few of them feel that way. I think the guys full of shit. I tell him there's no way in hell I'm tearing up my art just because he's superstitious. I tell him he can pay the $10 bucks and do whatever the hell he wants with it. But I'm not tearing up a piece of my art because he's ignorant. He says he's going to get security. I tell him that's a good idea and that he shouldn't waste any time. 10 minutes later... Roley Poley's Dad and security guy. Security guy hears the spiel and realizes the guy is full of shit. ""Sir, I can't make him tear up something because you're superstitious. You can either buy it from him or accept it."" Roley Poley's Dad proceeds to hand me $10 bucks and threaten to kick my ass. I laugh. I've been in enough fights to know I could wrap his ass around his ears. I take the money and go back to work. Security guy tells Roley Poley's Dad to stay away. He's causing too much trouble. ...no sweat off my back. I hate stupid people. Anyways, the rest of the day was pretty good. Worked from 12:00 - 4:00. Made about $70. Did 7 individual caricatures(including roley poley kid's). Finally feeling some control over airbrush. Lots more tiny defined lines, like hair and outlines. Definitely getting the likenesses down better. Pretty good day overall. Lessons learned today -- 1. I need to get more efficient. I need to have a better rack for my paints, have them in order, and go in the same order everytime. ""Eliminate all excess motions."" 2. Demo caricatures are a GREAT way to get people in line. 3. Have kids ask parents permission before doing ""free"" caricatures. Even if you're just fucking trying to be nice to the kid. Sheesh!"

In fact the Kerry campaign is probably quite happy that the filmmaker is leaving town today. Moore is actually heading into George W. Bush's backyard in Crawford Texas, where he will introduce a showing of his film Fahrenheit 9/11 at a football stadium. Moore says he has invited the film's star, President Bush, to attend the show. While Fahrenheit 9/11 has now topped the $100 million mark, no theater in Crawford or the surrounding towns would show the movie, until last week when it was picked up by a theater in Waco. That's why Moore decided to do his own screening near Bush's Crawford ranch."""

doc01206,3,"I just got back from seeing urlLink Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story with my brother. It had to be one of the funniest things I have seen in a while. Now there is different types of funny, but this was one of those movies that you just have to take it for what it's worth. 90 minutes of stupid, slapstick comedy, where you just sit back and enjoy. I don't need to tell you what happens but there are a few thoughts on the movie I would like to share. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn seemed to work really well together. As I am sure you have seen in the previews, Stiller is over the top while Vaughn steps back and watches Stiller make a fool of himself. This had it's moments but the funny man here was once again Rip Torn. I talked about his greatness in The Larry Sanders Show, and he's at it again in Dodgeball. The delivery by Torn is perfect, and I enjoyed his screen time more than the rest of the cast. Dodgeball is not a great movie by any stretch, but if you are wanting some silly fun this is the movie for you. I have no problems giving this movie my approval, and all should go check it out. Pay close attention to Jason Batemans bit part. It looks like he is having too much fun on the Ocho!"

doc01224,2,"I have not written about the party for a reason.&nbsp; My father's brother Steve has deeply set emotional issues.&nbsp; The only reason his marriage to his deceased wife Cheryl was 'perfect' was that she only argued with him once.&nbsp; If Steve gets his way, if you agree with him, more importantly, if you don't piss him off, he's your friend for life. Steve is a very bitter man,&nbsp;has a very caustic tongue, and his friendship comes with a price.&nbsp; In his attempts to be 'honest', what he does is completely tear a person down, attack them in their weak spots, put that person down and build himself up.&nbsp; I don't think he realises this, but I've seen it, and been the subject of his barbed tongue often enough to know. To be honest, I have no idea exactly why he is mad at me.&nbsp; What I do know is that he walked into the party and proceeded to pick a fight with me.&nbsp; I think I was within reasonable bounds to order him to leave after he walked up to me and said, ""You're a bitch, you're a liar, you're not welcome in my house, and I don't even want to talk to you anymore.""&nbsp; When I told him to leave, that I would not tolerate being spoken to like that, Steve threatened to hit me in the face. No one heard his threat to hit me, only me telling him I was calling 911. GAWD. I don't say any of what I just wrote about Steve with bitterness.&nbsp; I am bluntly honest, especially about myself and my actions.&nbsp; If I did something to aggrivate him to the point where he felt justified in threatening to hit me, I would write about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is never justification for someone to threaten to hit anyone, mind you.&nbsp; The only reason he stayed at the party...had nothing to do with my siblings and cousins telling me I needed to calm down.&nbsp; The only reason, and I mean THE ONLY REASON Steve stayed is because I love my Dad...&nbsp; Steve was in my Dad's wedding party and stood with Dad when he married my Mom.&nbsp; I wanted the party to be a happy occasion for my parents.&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; On that day, this is all that mattered. I gotta say...it's fricking scary what I'm about to say publically...for the first time. My family would deny what I am about to say to their individual dying breaths most likely (though I certainly hope that does not happen for some time to come). I say this with no disrespect intended towards my Dad.&nbsp; I love both my parents very much. I am the daughter of an alcoholic.&nbsp; My life has been deeply affected by my Dad's alcoholism as his was, as he grew up in an alcoholic, abusive household.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, Steve's behavior also stems from growing up in&nbsp;the same alcoholic, abusive household as my Dad grew up in. Steve knew which of my buttons to push.&nbsp; It made him visibly happy to see me lose my cool.&nbsp; That is Steve's way of 'winning'. There comes a time...when the way things used to work simply don't work for you anymore.&nbsp; You can either continue on as things have been...or strike out in a new, uncharted direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognize that I have a problem. So...tonight, I went to my first Al-Anon meeting. What is Al-Anon? The following explanation and questions were taken from the following web site: urlLink http://www.acafg.com/did_you_grow_up.html &nbsp; Al-Anon is for families, relatives and friends whose lives have been affected by someone else's drinking.&nbsp; Many adults question whether they have been affected by alcoholism. If someone close to you has, or has had a drinking problem, the following questions may help you in determining whether alcoholism affected your childhood or present life, and if Al-Anon is for you.(Reprinted by permission from Al-Anon World Service Office) &nbsp; Do you constantly seek approval and affirmation?&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you fail to recognize your own accomplishments? Do you fear criticism? Do you overextend yourself? Have you had problems with your own compulsive behavior? Are you uneasy when your life is going smoothly, continually anticipating problems? Do you feel more alive in the midst of crisis?&nbsp; Do you still feel responsible for the problem drinker in your life? Do you care for others easily, yet find it difficult to care for yourself? Do you isolate yourself from other people? Do you respond with fear to authority figures and angry people? Do you have trouble with intimate relationships? Do you attract and/or seek people who tend to be compulsive or abusive? Do you often mistrust your own feelings and the feelings expressed by others? Do you find it difficult to identify and express your emotions? Do you think parental drinking may have affected you? &nbsp; Alcoholism is a family disease. Those of us who have lived with this disease as children sometimes have problems which the Al-Anon program can help us to resolve. If you have answered ""YES"" to some or all of the above questions, Al-Anon may help. You can contact Al-Anon by checking in your local phone directory &nbsp; ******************************************** I answered more of those questions in the affirmative than I care to admit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be honest, I don't know about this.&nbsp; What I do know is, that I&nbsp;something needs to change...and that something, or rather someone, is me. I will admit, I was not very happy at the meeting tonight. I asked someone I know who is an AA member to go to this meeting with me.&nbsp; The meeting was not a normal meeting, but rather a 15th Anniversary party for this particular group, with a pot luck and special speakers. I did not want to talk this time.&nbsp; I simply wanted to watch.&nbsp; The person I arrived with stood and announced to everyone that he had brought me with him tonight..that it was my very first time. My first thought?&nbsp; ""Oh F**K!"" Pardon me...but I was not happy.&nbsp; My choice as to whether or not I was going to announce my presence was taken from me.&nbsp; I wasn't going to say anything, and nearly walked right out the door then. I don't mind being the center of attention.&nbsp; Sometimes I relish in it.&nbsp; In this circumstance though, I am dealing with the idea of confronting some seriously painful events/issues/etc...and didn't appreciate what happened. This person should have known better than to announce that I was a first-timer.&nbsp; He knew I was more than a bit ambivient and emotional about going, period. It's nothing to make a big deal over...but I will mention it to him at some point.&nbsp; His intentions were good.&nbsp; I simply am very *touchy* about this at the moment.&nbsp; This was not an *easy* decision for me...to make what I guess you might call my first step.&nbsp; Moving on...

doc01226,6,"Greetings from Sydney.. The first half of the flight when easily enough, however from Singapore to Sydney I had a small French child pelting me over the head with his toy fire engine. Bastard. Then, when I thought he'd finally given in and gone to sleep, he got a kind of confused and frowning expression on his face, followed by what can only be described as a unholy stench filtering out of his nappy, filling the cabin. Eugh. So I'm completely knackered and making my way towards customs. I have sprinted down the arrivals corridor to get there quickly as I know from experience that you do NOT want to be the last person queuing behind the contents of a 747 at Australian Immigration control. I get through really easily, the guy even cracks a joke with me and I head towards the baggage reclaim. When what appears to be a 12 year old customs official steps out and wants to ask me a few questions. Actually, my entire life's history and my inside leg measurement would be more accurate. ""So.. You're an I.T. contractor. Do you need and qualifications for that?"" ""Well, there's lots of lights and stuff.."" That went down like a lead balloon. After twenty hours in a steel tube with a screaming French baby and some really dire movies, I wasn't in the mood to fuck around. After checking I wasn't smuggling in anything more illicit than a couple of jars of marmite, I was free to go. Michael was kind enough to feed me scotch and coke for a few hours, which ensured that when I did go to bed at a sensible hour I was well and truly out of the game. Quiet day today to get over the jet lag, then some shopping tomorrow in Chatswood's ""fucking huge"" shopping centres. I'll keep you posted."

Wrapped in a sari and about to light a cigarette with Dodger playing with my pencil basket and stereo cords, with Tori softly coming out of this hunk of shit excuse of a computer. CB is asleep in my bed and I feel so desolate once again. How do I explain it when I am supposed to be so happy? He is so tired from trying to keep up with my intensity and I thought his was just a strong but it isn't and I can feel his love and it's enough to make me smile and his touch is enough to make me feel content but it's not filling the void that's inside my soul and perhaps that's a huge fucking clue. I have to get Dodger out of here he is going to wake CB up and when he wakes up he gets curious. Argh, okay it's just that I can feel so fucking much and it's confusing me. Its just confusing the need and want right out of me and I just have to look at my life for once and accept it the way it is, for only through acceptance that you can move forward. I know we love each other but I know that right now in my life I'm in a very bad place, I feel physically inferior when he isn't around, I feel like I have the intellectual movements of a snail on heroin, I mean there is no stimulus that isn't coming from him, do you see how angry that would make me? An hour ago I was lying in his arms and singing Smashing Pumpkin songs while playing the tunes along his naked back and watching his closed eyes and his smile and it just blows me away that I have someone who cares about me and I am just sitting here. Just sitting here writing this to an audience that doesn't fucking exist. Last night was bizarre my stomach is twisting and grimacing in remembrance, fuck, fuck. Do you know what we did? My sister and her best friend, Jan, and CB, we all...Well, I'll start at the beginning. Jos� Cuervo $50 bottle of Tequila gets smashed because the fucking strap of my bag breaks. Right on the steps of Liver...Is this a Hole? Pool station. CB says it doesn't matter but it did. I got so mad I punched a few walls, it was because the whole concept of $50 really got to me. But I apologised and he said it didn�t matter so we meet Jan in the bus stop, get home, buy another bottle, this time Conquistador, a Mexican-Made White Tequila and we played a drinking game with sex god Trey Parker, yeah you know the one �BaseketBall�, every time they said dude, we would lick sip suck."

What kind of man says he's off to the grocery store on a Sunday morning and doesn't return until early Monday morning? I guess it doesn't really matter. In the intervening hours, I have come to a decision. My marriage is over. It's just not over yet. I must steel myself to do what women since the beginning of time have done. Be patient, wait. The bills must be paid off. When I leave, I don't want to be in debt. I want to be free and clear. That must come first. I shall endeavor to be a good wife and mother, and all the while, I will be working hard to pay off the bills while beginning a savings account of my own. One hundred and fifty dollars a month to start, direct deposited. I found that there was very little emotion this time. I have become apathetic to the whole thing. I want my life back, I want myself back. I don't want to be shut in with the paranoia, the distrust, the rub of feeling that is too painful to bear. I want to be free of it. But, I want to be free of it on my own terms. I am a strong individual. Perhaps I was never meant to be married in the first place. Perhaps I was naive enough to believe that he wouldn't stray into the depths of his disease after so long out of them. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. I want my strength back. So now, I settle down to wait. I can do that. I've had lots of practice."

doc01232,3,"urlLink Reflections on What Happens When Librarians Become Teachers This is by Kimberley Donnelly. It was published in Computers in Libraries , vol. 20 no. 3, March 2000. From the site: Instruction librarians and teaching libraries are getting a lot of attention these days. Are you thinking you should pursue these activities in your library? Would you like to become a teacher? Do you think you should? Most librarians agree that someone has to teach our library users how to use our resources effectively, and that somebody should be teaching students effective ways to use the Internet for research. However, few agree on who should teach and just how the instruction should be carried out. On some college campuses, the logical solution to teaching research is to create a course. While this may be an objective worthy of librarians’ advocacy and involvement, a delicate balance exists between the rewards and the costs of becoming a teaching library. Here at York College of Pennsylvania (YCP), librarians were thrust into the classroom in 1997 when a two-credit, core-curriculum information literacy course was introduced. Generated by a faculty task force as part of a new core, Information Literacy 101 (IFL) is dramatically changing the jobs and roles of our librarians and focusing attention on the library, since it’s designed and taught by faculty librarians. Schmidt Library, formerly viewed as an academic support service, is now an integral part of the educational mission of the college. Hundreds of students pass through the turnstile every day on their way to the IFL classroom. The changes we’ve seen are both philosophical and practical. For this article I’ve gathered some personal reflections—my own and those of our other faculty librarians. So I am offering some firsthand insight into what happens when a group of librarians becomes teachers. All the changes are connected to the way our relationships are changing, the amount of time and energy that IFL requires, and the kinds of shifts that IFL is causing in our priorities."

I think it was good to have the time to think about what I really want to do with myself. Now I feel pretty fired up about getting job, writing, exercising, eating better, etc. Europe also made me appreciate all the nice things I have here. Like I can walk down to the library and find pretty much any book I want. I still remember the book starvation in the Czech Republic. For a while there, I was praying for words in English, anything, a VCR instruction manual, anything, just let it be in English, please! But that is behind me now. I also appreciate hotel rooms. When I stayed in Vegas with my parents, we went into the room and said to myself ""wow, what a big bed. And there aren't any strange people here talking or throwing things. Ahhh."" Now any hotel room that I don't have to share with strangers is pretty luxurious. It's good to appreciate the small things."
doc01239,1,"From February 26: Ok. Let's just get this out of the way. I did it; it's done. After four months of being an Extraordinary Strong Wondergirl Valedictorian Beauty-Queen Genius who DID NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WHATSOEVER with her ex-boyfriend, I gave in. I emailed him. Whew. Ok. First let's cover what this effort at contacting him was not . It was not motivated by alcohol. It was not motivated by late-night loneliness. It was NOT a heartfelt epic poem that relied heavily on flower imagery or similes that compared my still-lingering love to an eternal flame. There was, in fact, no reference to love, still-lingering or otherwise. No flames. Nor was it hate-mail. Nor was there ever even an urge to make it hate-mail. Really. So that's the easy part: What it wasn't. Check. Now we get to the harder part. What it WAS. Well, this is what it SAID, ""Hey M-- I'm going with a friend to a story slam tonight, and was thinking about you. Wondered if you ever got up to tell one of your stories? Tonight's topic is ""stranded."" When the topic is ""children's theater,"" I wil be unstoppable. Would be good to hear from you, K."" I will totally own that the whole ""going with a friend"" thing was an unnecessary and blatant attempt at making him wonder whether or not I and this ""friend"" are currently engaging in hours and hours of carnal lovemaking, during which I frequently yell things like ""You're so much better in bed than my last boyfriend!!!!"". Fine. I admit it. Sue me. The rest will take me some time to figure out. Which I'm going to do right now. With my friend, this huge martini."

Now don't get me wrong it was great but I'm glad to have it over so now I don't need to tell little fibs and worry that people won't show or have fun or be cranky with me. Here is a list of the things that I have learned: 1. Do it yourself (less stress) 2. Plan for people to eat more than they usually would 3. Women can chat for hours unless given direction 4. Even simple games can be quite amusing 5. Middle Age/Old people give the rudest gifts (sex kit, massage oil, sex game) 6. Your friends face when she walks in the door and sees everything is priceless and almost brings tears to your eyes The shower went very well as far as I could tell.

doc01247,4,"I'm a ""Mice and Men"" kinda guy, and I'm going to agree with Thomas' ""it's a comfortable read"" quote. It's mostly dialogue and fun, quite frankly. Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected. Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military? Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries. Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again? Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq. Afghanastan was a justified war. I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade. What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade. He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief. Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected. I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions. The more I think about it the sicker I get. I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit. Love, Rob P.S. I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know."

Weaker men might have even started to cry. But this was no time for cowardice, this was a time to stand up to the enemy, look him square in the nose and say ""mofo, yo ass goin' down"". Unfortunately, fear got the better of me and I waited there, surrounded on all sides by paint wielding marksmen who cared nothing about my cold fingers and soiled pants. I wanted to cry, I wanted to put my arm in the air and scream ""Don't shoot me I'm full of chocolate"". But I didn't, I waited there, amidst the phut of glycerine balls just waiting to pop my eyes like grapes. I waited and I waited, occasionally firing a salvo of badly aimed shots at moving targets, occasionally hitting the odd tree or barricade but never my intended victim. And so the stalemate continued. I sat there, moist from my own urine - more afraid of mortal pain than a tuppenny whore with consumption, whilst my comrades got slaughtered like sambos on lynchin' day. I popped my head around the corner of my barricade. Speeding paint nearly put me out of the game but somehow missed, taking out more of my brothers in arms as they impacted. Whilst my brutal foe powdered their muskets, my goal became clear - the target was in site. I knew what must be done. 'Their's not to reason why but to do and die"".

They sent out 'packets' a month ago with all the damn nursing math stuff, abbreviations, and some prefix/suffix things we have to have memorized for a test on the first day of school. And we have to pass it. On top of that, at our orientation last week they basically told us to go buy our books and have the fors 50 pages of our workbook done by the time we get to class. oh joy. this sucks. Too much work...too little time. On the other hand I enjoy it. I can't wait to get into the clinical setting. I know it's going to be nothing compared to taking care of Jasmine. She's fed through a feeding tube during the night to make up for the calories she doesn't get during the day. (she just started eating about 4 months ago and she's doing quite well I might add!) And her mother is another frustrating thing. She's such a bitch. I don't know anyone who doesn't want their daughter to be healthy. She wants her to be on a feeding tube the rest of her life. She wants her daughter to be dependent on her. WTF??? The hardest thing about being a parent is letting go and making your child as indepedent as you possibly can. oh well....I'll ramble about that bitch later. I really need to go to bed. ugh sometimes I just wish I could fast forward my life 2 years....."

doc01268,2,"I've come to the realization a while ago that I needed to get out of Vancouver. Just for a week or so. Thank Gad for my friend Norm up at 100 mile house. His generosity extended itself above and beyond the call of friendship, to invite me up there for a week. I'm taking him up on the offer. He told me he wants me to relax. I certainly need to get away from all the busy-ness in town, and sit somewhere near the water and read a book or six. I've taken a ""Medical Stress Leave"" from work, compensated by Medical Employment Insurance. The drama happening at work (which I'm sorry to say, I haven't posted in here, lets just say it was shitloads...) as well as the emotional wrecking ball which is my relationship status and finances, had finally taken its toll. The doctor actually classified it as ""Situational Depression."" Where a few months ago I felt ""Soul weary"" now I feel utterly lost. Lost in myself, and lost to myself. I found myself sobbing Wednesday night without anything to stop it. (not crying. I mean serious, heart-wrenching sobbing. I'm sure Tom, my next door neighbor, thought I was dying or something... It wasn't pretty.) I've only ever broken this way one time before, when I was seventeen, working in a factory, and a girl on the line I was controlling the speed on, seemed to have some sort of emotional meltdown. I blamed myself for it at the time, because of the speed I was moving the equipment. Thankfully, I had my Father there to console me. I called Norm, deciding to try to distract myself. And because he always makes me feel good inside. He did a good job. He got me laughing, and relaxed, and definitely proved his merit as a friend. Not that he had to... But I'm eternally grateful. He might not have known exactly what was going on, and thought of it as a regular, run of the mill phone call, but truthfully, he was the person I thought of when I knew that everyone else would ask too many questions, and he would just chat me up and make me smile and blush. A very worthy conversation in my humble opinion. Thank-you Norm. The doctor prescribed me some anti-depressant pills, and also wrote me off of work for a month. They'll get rid of the majority of the depression I've been feeling, and they'll also kill my sex drive. Quite frankly, maybe that's something I need as well. One month away from all the bullshit. One month to gather my thoughts, and find myself a little more as a person, and the last two weeks of it are going to be creating an updated resume and finding myself a new choice of occupation. Honestly, I don't get paid enough to deal with the garbage that floats around my work. I'm not a weak person, but everyone is weak sometimes. Lately everything has been eating away at the foundations underneath me (Not in a good way.) and has left me tottering on the brink. Between sanity and insanity, or maybe just leaving me with the feeling of a complete lack of control with my situation. Being a control freak, that is pushing me past my limits. I'm trying to take Dave's advice and just ""Let it go."" but it's so damned hard. My memory is shoddy lately, My hands are shaking... Most of the time just a small tremble. However, that is what is scaring me the most. It's never affected me physically like this. Ever. I can't get a full solid night's sleep anymore, I get overwhelmed with anxiety, and I'm taking my frustration out on people that don't deserve it. My apologies. Seriously. I don't like who I am right now either. I miss being the person that looked approachable, instead of this woman with a gruff hard exterior, the bravado and bluster hiding this wounded inner being. The last time I felt ""happy"" was at Spain's fireworks display with Ryan, where I teased the firemen walking about before the show started, sang the ""Hari Krishna"" tune (you would have to hear it to understand what I'm talking about...) that he and I made up and always jokingly sing when they parade through like so many diapered, salmon-pink clad clowns, and the sight of those huge, shimmering, golden explosions in the sky were so beautiful that I actually had tears in my eyes. Granted, that was only a week and a half ago, but I think someone should be happy more than once in three months. I really have a hard time having my instability so damned visible to everyone else. So visible that my Boss sees it, and chooses to exploit it. On another note . My condolences go out to Devin. We've been through some seriously rough times, but he recently lost a dear family member. As angry as I am over him treating me unfairly, and not giving me closure, he deserves some sympathy over this. He could even get angry with me, for doing this, but you know what? To hell with it. I'm not doing this to disrespect Darla. I'm doing this to show my respects for someone that led a long life and that obviously meant something to someone that I care about. I would do it for anyone I know. I've been angry with him for weeks, and I have respect for him even if he can't show me the respect that I deserve. I still love him in my own way. I miss him terribly as a friend. If that makes me a fool, or a masochist. Whatever. I don't care anymore. I never really forget the people I loved. I'm sorry for your loss Devin. I've been in your shoes regarding my grandfather. I still miss him, and it pains me to know that I have a hard time remembering his face and voice now. In Memorium Darla Raye Thompson 1929 - 2004"
doc01269,3,"I spent my whole Saturday at the Armory Meet. I didn't have to be there, but I was an alternate for the 3200 Relay and Kendra didn't want to be the only person there to help write down the times of our teams and other teams. So I got up at 6AM and went to school, ready with my blanket and pillow for the long ride to the Baltimore Armory. It was, oh, about 8 degrees Fahrenheit (sp?) outside, and we got a damn cheese-bus (a regular school bus, not a nice coach bus)!!! Anyway, the ride was about a half hour long, and when we got there we all got off the cheese and walked a few blocks to the entrance of the Armory, to be greeted by Army dudes with guns strapped to their hips and slung about their chests. Then we went in and found a little spot by the corner near the barracks area. There were thirty other schools there, some from MD, some not. But it was cool, all in all. It hurt my butt sitting on the hard ground taking down times, but I guess I'm kind of glad we went. The girls were close to getting a few medals, but they always got fourth place (when you needed third to get a medal) by a few tenths of a second. The guys, overall, got first place, and got a big bowl for a trophy. In any case, after Coach Ward put barbeque chips in the bowl on the bus, Littlejohn somehow broke the bowl from its stand and Coach Limaata wore the bowl upside-down as a hat. That's basically my weekend. In other news, I wrote up a bio for another RPG (one that I was invited to join, and gladly accepted the offer) and 'unofficially' I am going to join forces (*evil laugh*) with an awesome writer with whom I've already had the pleasure to game, and all is well with the world...except that I have a four-page report due on the character Simon from ""Lord of the Flies"" including the analogy between him and Christ as saviors for the evils of mankind...something to that extent. Due tomorrow. And it's four-thirty in the afternoon..."
doc01270,1,"People are strange So it's Tuesday and I am back at work after a weekend from hell.......so let's see it all started off Friday night, when we decided to go to the movies, I wanted to watch ""Bend it Like Beckham"" (I think that is how you spell the last name) and instead they decided to watch ""Phone Booth"", which wasn't bad at all, but I am just not a fan of Colin Farrell, I think mainly because 95% of the female population is. So saturday I hung out a friends place and got a sun burn on my face which was not in any way my intentions, and it is still red till today....I have no idea when it will turn a nice shade of brown to give my olive complection alittle more colour, as if I need it. So later that night we headed to a club that we normally go to and have no problems there, however saturday night was a different story. First off there were A LOT of weird peole there that night, mainly the 4 foot 11, 12 year old looking who tried all night to pick-up my friend ans his oh so obviously gay friend trying to hit on me. So we went to another room and it just got worse....so we hung out for a bit then decided to leave and head out for some food to soak up all the alcohol we had consumed. So I rolled in at around 3:45am and watched tv, and realized I was getting old. I know, I know, I am only 25, but I am getting tired of seeing weirdos in clubs and bars. What ever happen to having house parties where I could look forward to hearing the Beasite Boys till 4 am and thinking that we did have to fight for our right to party and where can I find this ""Brass Monkey"". All those days seem to be long behind me. Sunday came and I had to do some stuff around town and I was starting to feel ill....Monday came and I was to be in court at 9 am all the way in cottage counrty, so needless to say I didn't get a lot of sleep sunday night, and last night was just as bad...I think I feel asleep at 11:30pm woke up at 12:30 am and only feel back asleep at 3:30am, then I had to wake up at 6:30 and that was a struggle. And just to add to my sleepless night, I had watched ""The Ring"" early yesterday afternoon and it creeped me out to the point where I thought the little girl was going to crawl out of my tv and kill me. Yup! I am a chicken when it comes to scary movies......I think it all started when my babysitter made me watch the Exorcist at age 5...ya I think that's as far back we can trace this fear...... So here I am back at work wondering why I am back here and why I haven't moved on....I am so tired of talking that I think I am actually going to start doing things..........we'll see how that goes, I will keep you posted....."

doc01272,4,"Roger Ebert urlLink talks about the criticism of Michael Moore's new movie. ""The wise French director Godard once said, ""The way to criticize a film is to make another film."" That there is not a pro-Bush documentary available right now I am powerless to explain. Surely, however, the Republican National Convention will open with such a documentary, which will position Bush comfortably between Ronald Reagan and God. The Democratic convention will have a wondrous film about John Kerry. Anyone who thinks one of these documentaries is ""presenting facts objectively without editorializing"" should look at the other one."" Everything in America has to be black and white. This movie has not even come out yet and every Conservative Republican is up in arms about this film. This is something I'll never understand. When a person aligns themselves with a certain ideology they become so personally offended by anything that even ""questions"" their side of the aisle. If for some reason the other ""side"" seems to be gaining ground we just call into question their character. I've seen this recently in response to the movie urlLink SAVED! and now again with urlLink Farenheit . My question is what are we afraid of? Is it that we're so afraid to be wrong, or that we're even more afraid that someone so opposite from me on some sort of religious/political/moral issue might be (kinda) right. I mean waht if I don't have the market cornered on the truth. I'll go ahead and admit that Moore is just as defensive and angry about things as everyone else, but that's another post. Who knows, maybe this movie will change things a little bit in America, but I'm guessing it will just be a bit more yelling, screaming, and finger pointing. God bless America."

doc01275,1,"Anger is a condition in which the tongue works faster than the mind. You can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worrying over the future. Love ......and you shall be loved. God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with Him. All people smile in the same language. A hug is a great gift..one size fits all. It can be given for any occasion and it's easy to exchange. Everyone needs to be loved...especially when they do not deserve it. The real measure of a man's wealth is what he has invested in eternity. Everything has beauty but not everyone sees it. It's important for parents to live the same things they teach. If you fill your heart with regrets of yesterday and the worries of tomorrow, you have no today to be thankful for. Happy memories never wear out.... relive them as often as you want. Home is the place where we grumble the most, but are often treated the best. Man looks at outward appearance but the Lord looks within. The choice you make today will usually affect tomorrow. Take time to laugh for it is the music of the soul. If anyone speaks badly of you, live so none will believe it. Patience is the ability to idle your motor when you feel like stripping your gears. Love is strengthened by working through conflicts together. The best thing parents can do for their children is to love each other. Harsh words break no bones but they do break hearts. To get out of a difficulty, one usually must go through it. We take for granted the things that we should be giving thanks for. Love is the only thing that can be divided without being diminished. Happiness is enhanced by others but does not depend upon others. You are richer today if you have laughed, given or forgiven. For every minute you are angry with someone, you lose 60 seconds of happiness that you can never get back. Do what you can, for who you can, with what you have, and where you are. THE BEST GIFTS TO GIVE: To your friend - loyalty To your enemy - forgiveness; To your boss - service; To a child - a good example; To your parents - gratitude and devotion; To your mate - love and faithfulness;"
doc01276,4,"They froze my back while I gave birth. It was then I thought my simple heart would find its rest. It was like waking up in the two parts air and one part silk breast of a dragonfly after ten months of elephantine consequence. I thought: what bliss. These are the tricks your clever spirit plays before the bleakest brinks. The out-of-body experience was next. I actually wrote the above, which was actually published a month ago. The title, Calloo Callay, refers to the poem Jabberwocky -- I wrote it for an issue of a magazine on happiness -- and the lines by Lewis Carroll go, ""O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay!"" he chortled in his joy."" After all that fiddling around making her happen, she came out the usual way. At the end of my pregnancy, both Dr. V -- my reproductive endocrinologist, and Dr. L, my ob gyn -- decided that P must be a more-highly observed baby, as if that were possible after at least two dozen ultrasounds. So for six weeks in April and May, I left work and waddled to the hospital on Wednesday afternoons, sometimes bringing galley proofs to read in bed, and registered as if I were staying. Then I had an ultrasound, and went upstairs to Labor and Delivery for a non-stress test. What is a non-stress test? Many of you know. You lie there quietly and think about how in a few weeks you'll be lying there in the worst pain of your life, and they give you a glass of apple juice, and they monitor the baby's heartbeat for an hour. While there, you listen to lots of moaning and babies being born and cheering. That is a wonder. You wish it were your turn, so you could get it over with and finally gaze upon your own feet in the first time in months. P's birth was scheduled for my due date. My disease carries a high incidence of gestational diabetes, which can appear at any time, and though I was screened for it monthly (and in a 3-hour-glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks, most people only have to do the half-hour one) they didn't want the placenta to become post-mature. The baby can die from a postmature placenta in a high risk mother, so if she didn't make her appearance beforehand I would be induced. Do you mind induction? one nincompoop asked. Isn't it unnatural? ""Are you kidding me?"" I said. ""This entire baby was contrived through unnatural means. Who am I to stand on nature's side now? It didn't do anything for me in the past! Bring on the drugs! More, more, I want more!"" However,I will say that in my anaesthesia preregistration, I said no narcotics. They make me throw up, and you know how much I hate that. I had seen a birth before, by the way -- my nephew. Natural birth. Between blood curdling screams, my sister-in-law panted, ""Is this scaring you away from having your own baby?"" ""No,"" I replied. ""It's scaring me away from having my own baby without drugs ."" We went to the birthing classes -- those are hilarious. Nineteen apple-cheeked women who need help getting up, and nineteen reluctant guys in flannel shirts who try to feign a modicum of interest -- until the lights are lowered and the breastfeeding video commences. Is it me or did they show a lot of gratuituous (I nearly wrote gratu tit ous) footage in this video? I think I saw one baby -- in the introduction. Other than that, it was all boobs, all the time. All it needed was a pulsing techno soundtrack. There was a gradual shifting and settling in the room, as if the men now knew they'd come to the right place. S was riveted. He knew more about breastfeeding than me when the video was done. But anyway, the rest of the stuff they tell you in birthing class -- pointless. So by the time I arrived for my induction, at 10 PM on a Monday night -- May 8, 2000 -- with Dr. L's words in my head: ""you're not effaced and you're not dilated, so it will be like starting a car in the snow -- you'll have a baby by Wednesday afternoon, most likely"" -- I was woefully unprepared, rather like someone who got their degree in Advanced Microsurgery by mail order by sending in boxtops and a rubber band. It had gotten hot over the weekend, and since I was ""as big as a house"" (this a direct quote from my father), the anonymous heatrash was back. I had spent the weekend, fact, semi clothed with mini fans pointed at various strategic points of my gigantic person, eating ramen noodles and watching movies, with my social worker mother in law by my side. I only had one outfit that fit that was weather appropriate -- the black tank and shorts, I still wear it to bed, you should see it now. Thank God she came from Toledo to take care of me at the end! I had a certified therapist by my side for the last five days of my pregnancy. We talked about the following fears I had: 1. Will I die? 2. Will the baby die? 3. I don't care if it hurts but will I be able to stand it if it hurts? And what if I die? Then who will take care of the baby? 4. What was I thinking, doing this in the first place? 5. I want my mommy!!!! I will love her all my life for listening to that for five days. The weekend before, I found myself leaning over chairs a lot. My back hurt. I knew it was because an entire human was days from emerging from my abdomen, but I didn't also know that was my body getting ready for labor. It was something happening. Here's how it went down: 10:30 PM: Emergency room nurse takes one look at me and says, ""Labor and delivery?"" I nod and off we go. 10:40 PM: I put on the heinous blue gown with the open back and the little anchor print, with a matching peignoir (another gown reversed). 10:45 PM: S begins channel surfing. They have graciously provided him with two naugahyde slingback chairs for his sleeping comfort. 11:00 PM: The first of 10,000 people arrives to flip up the heinous blue gown and probe about in my internal apparatus. 11:30 PM: An ob who looks about my age (""you'll like her,"" Dr. L, now home tucked snugly into bed no doubt, assured me previously) sticks a pill that's supposed to bring it on up there . 11:45 PM: One of the handmaidens makes me swallow a sleeping pill ""to take the edge off."" They hook up a monitor and there is P's heart -- swoosh swoosh swoosh. A miracle! S turns off the light -- we're supposed to sleep. Midnight. The swooshing is driving us insane. We turn the monitor down. 12:10 AM: They come back in and turn the monitor up. 12:11 AM: We turn it back down. 12:30 AM: I fall into a twilight sleep in my bed, which S is cursing me for having because the naugahyde is sticking to his legs. I ask if he wants to climb into bed with me. He says, ""No, you're too big for me to fit."" 1:30 AM: The teen doctor comes in and ""checks the pill."" ""I'm going to strip your membranes now,"" she says. ""It hasn't even dissolved at all."" Q: What does membrane stripping feel like? A: Select the sharp object of your choice and sit on it, taking care to make sure it penetrates the most tender part of your skin and goes inside your body. Wiggle around on this object for about thirty seconds until you're ready to faint. That's what it feels like. 2:00 AM: A polar bear is chewing on my spine. 2:01 AM: We get up and walk down the hall. Sleepless mothers are watching the weather channel in darkened rooms in the nursery section. I am the only imbecile here tonight actually having a baby. But that will change -- the nursery will be chockablock by the time P gets here, and everyone will have come in after me and have had nice tidy C's where you get to see the baby immediately. 3:30: I must've passed out for ten minutes. The goddamned polar bear, would he stop that fucking gnawing! 3:45: Great. Now my ovary's exploding. This is all I need. S does some pointless, semi-placating rubs on my back. This is akin to putting vaseline on a bullet wound and hoping for the best. 4:00: Teen doctor probes and yawns and says she'll see me later on, someone else is coming on call, but boy I look good. I am getting there. I should have a baby by afternoon. Look at those contractions! No more walking around, now. She turns up the monitor. We turn it back down after she goes. 4:10 Yes. Look at those contractions. 4:30: S: (rustling the report) That one went up to ninety! 4:31: I know. 5:25: It's about time this bastard got here with his needles and his drugs. Hurry up, damn you, you fucking people. If I weren't so tired this wouldn't only be an interior monologue. 5:30: You're doing beautifully. Holding up with such grace, Rose. 5:31: To the tune of ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat:"" Fuck fuck a fucky duck, fuck a doodle doo. When you get yourself knocked up, this is what you'll do. Shit. I used ""do"" twice, must get better rhyme for do . UGH Maaaaw. Karen was wrong -- this is worse than the sigmoidoscopy. The goddamn gnawing ! Oh, God, saints preserve me -- God, God, God, where are you, where are you, where are you, be here now please . 5:32 Ah God. What have I done. 6:00: ahhhhhhhh. Bliss. The polar bear has gone back in his igloo. What the fuck? Polar bears don't live in igloos, you stupid, stupid woman. 6:45: Dr. L comes with his hook and breaks the water. If I had known it was just like a pick-up stick that could do the whole thing in, I'd've been more careful during my pregnancy when sitting down. 7:00: S: Well, if you don't need me, I'm going to go mosey down and get some breakfast. 7:01: You do that, you stinking rotten . .. why can't any words come out of my mouth? Why do I keep smiling at everyone? 9:00: Phone begins ringing. This time sister-in-law. She shows up with a camera. Weeks later I will wish to burn the ""before"" pictures of me. 9:30: -How's it going in here? -Fine. Is this it? I feel so good I think my heart will stop. The drug's just going everywhere. Do I have legs? -You do. That's great. It's working. -I feel blissful. -That's part of it. -Is this it? I mean, it got bad during the night, but is this it? I feel so good. -This is it! You'll just feel a little pressure now. First babies take a long time to come out. You'll be pushing a good long while. Don't worry, you'll do great. -How long?! -Oh, I'd say an hour and a half at the least. Try not to worry. Everything's fine. 9:45: This is called pitocin. It'll get things moving -- I'm just going to find a line here, my goodness your veins are weak. 10:00: We're going to put this special monitor on the baby's head. How does this heart monitor keep getting turned down? 10:15: Let me just have a look here . .. . 10:45: I'll need to empty your bladder. 11:00 Ah. The Price is Right. Bob Barker always calms me down. 11:01. Wait a minute. I think I need something else. I'm feeling it again.Can I get something else? What is taking him so long? -He's with other patients. -Goddamn it, get someone else! I don't want this again. 11:02: (hear sister in law whispering on phone): She's doing well, but she's getting very impatient . Yes. Impatient. Yes. 11:30: That's better. But why isn't it working as well this time? Ah God, I have to push something out. Something! 11:45: You can start, hon. Start pushing. Where's the doctor? He won't be here until the baby crowns. What? Why bother hiring anyone? We'll take care of you. Just do your thing. 12:00 I push in sets of three, with S and sis-in-law (also S) with their annoying counting at my ears. Looking up at my reflection in the tv, I see some awful nightmare in my undercarriage, so I ask them to turn it aside. 12:30: There's a lip on your cervix that won't . . .the baby's head. There was some meconium stain . . .it could've been from weeks ago. Doesn't necessarily mean. Pneumonia. Bob Barker. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Shut the fuck up, shut up, shut up, shut up! Why can't I talk! 12:45: Well, I don't know why her forearm is black. Oh no, look at that IV -- totally infiltrated. Why weren't you looking out for this? Do the other arm. 1:00 I don't know why your first push is so weak, your second is good and your third is weak. You need to . ... effort now. 1:15 I can't talk. I don't feel like being here anymore. Maybe if I skip one set of pushes, they won't know . . .! They might not know, that's what I'll do, I'll skip -- wait, they have that damn monitor, if I could just kick it out of the way, they wouldn't. Ah, whatever, here I go. Okay, forget this room. I'm at work, I'm working on a catalog. There's the phone. Good morning, it's me. Yes? The print run? 30,000? Wait a minute, I'll be back in a sec. 1:16 Not this goddamned room again with these fucking counting people. 1:25 I see the head. Call the doctor! She has hair! Oh, it's so sweet! 1:26: Call the doctor? Call him? Isn't he here? Shouldn't he be here? 1:27: Thanks for holding, Joan. Okay, it was four color. Yes, three signatures. It's a big book! hahaha. I know. Just do the matte through the whole thing, I'll do an eighth bleed of that beige -- that'll save on the stock. Use a fifty pound. Yeah -- I don't know. I think you should do a spot varnish on that one spot. I wanted the bottle for the cover, the reflection in the bottle, like life being looked at and regarded from a distance, a metaphor for the experience. I'm sorry. Can you hold on? 1:30: S ties on the doctor's gown. I haven't screamed. Not once. 1:36: The cord is around her neck, so I want you to give one big push -- we need that now. 1:38 Panic returns and I rent myself in twain. A great, big, giant thing that feels like a head comes out of me. 1:39: Now get the rest of her out. That was simple. 1:40: I scream and cheer and cry all at once: she's here, she's here! 1:41: I hear sucking. And sucking. No crying. A minute. Then one. A cry. A cry! We got those lungs cleaned out nice. Oh, look at this beautiful girl. So beautiful. My heart folds and snaps. Don't worry, honey, nice and pink. Here she is! Here she is!

doc01280,2,"Our Kia Sportage was having its yearly MOT and half-yearly service yesterday, and everything went smoothly. The tyres will have to be replaced soon, though and so will the brake pads, but so far it's OK. When we came home the fuel gauge was suddenly below Empty. Did they empty the fuel tank at the garage? Hardly, so it had to be something with the gauge. We went by the garage today, and the mechanic had a quick look at it, came back, looked serious, and told us the sender thing inside the fuel tank had stopped working. He kindly asked us if the car was still on warranty, and when we checked it turned out the warranty expires 3 July 2004. How lucky is that? I found a picture of a Sportage same age and same colour as ours."
doc01281,4,"No Adrian dreams, making for a day where I miss him even more than usual (how is that possible?). Plus the sun is shining for the 3rd day in a row, which makes me feel more overwhelmed! Don’t get me wrong, it is nice to see the snow covered mountains in the distance. It’s just too bright outside and my mood does not match the weather! Today Rebecca’s school has a family picnic that I’m completely dreading. I’ll go at 11.30 to eat lunch with her 2nd grade class then volunteer from 12 to 1 pm. I’m sorry I offered to volunteer but it means a lot to Rebecca. I do end up meeting such nice people (we’re still new to the school, just started this year, what a year to start!) and volunteering is always better than I imagine. Still the idea of being around festive people really makes me sick to my stomach. On the walk to the bus stop this morning I said to Rebecca “the picnic might be hard for you with other dad’s there”. And she said, (bless her heart) “mommy I’ll be fine, daddy is always here with me every day.” Statements like that really help me. Kids manage grief so differently that adults, where it is all consuming. Plus I often say to Rebecca what special times she had with her dad and how much good time they got together. I think she too appreciates the fun 5 years after he recovered from cancer. Also I’ve other things planned today that feel overwhelming. A person is coming over at 10 to prepare for our hardwood floor refinishing (only reason I’m doing that is insurance and I’m sure Adrian would want the floors fixed if we have the chance) because when Adrian first went into the hospital in September we had a mini-flood that damaged our already worn floor. Anyway this person is too cheerful, and that makes me sick too. I really don’t care about the floors, but know this needs to be done. Then I’ll do my usual work out at the Y. Forcing myself yet I always feel better after, but it’s all so overwhelming without Adrian. Also when I read about Tienamen Square 15 years ago, Adrian and I had the TV on to that when we were moving into the house. We were so appalled, naturally, but I feel this awful stomach punch every time I think of it, not only did all those people die, but Adrian is gone too. I’ll be ok, really, or so I keep telling myself. I do feel Adrian’s spirit with me; I just wish we had more time together. But his body gave out and lasted longer than anyone could’ve imagined. I'm grateful for what we had! Thanks for listening. Do you think I can make it ok? Kathy"

doc01284,1,"Perfection Impressario on grill, Salad Aficionado creating heaven, stragglers amongst us and what do we have ???? The un offical "" Louder "" BBQ kicking all tri-state area ass!!!!!!! A few of us got together and got the essentials for making this BBQ take off and make it at least somewhat decent. At 3pm, the grill was assembled and the coal was thrown on and with one match, "" on gaawa aawa.......we have fire ""!!! NOTE: get the matchlight coals, them suckers light up with no lighter fluid and it makes life easier. The porkchops and sangria( prepared by the ever so sexy Jayme ), this salad that still had me salivating early this morning. The sultan of salad, GinnaKarla threw this mix together as diligently as she does her poetry. I can't explain how good it was. I grabbed a plate before the food and I couldn't get over the explosion of taste in m mouth. Ginna is unabatedly "" The Bomb "". So, to the preparers of the food, Oscar ( Fruit choppin slugger that he is )Bermeo, Maria ( I am a chef and I don't need to be cooking more) Nieves, Ginna, Jayme, oh....... and me. I got the chicken ready and I really should have seasoned it much more. The day was hit off perfectly with a little bit of everything being brought from all different angles at the hours through the evening. Marty lugging her melons ( insert bad thought here ), Helen Yum making it the OFFICIAL BBQ when she brought her Macaroni Salad. She is awesome. Lynne bring some of the weirdest things to a BBQ that I have ever seen but sure enough, they were needed. This is what makes her great, that whole ability to see what others don't see. "" Lynne, I need lotto numbers "". Ray carrying some burgers from 83rd street and Jai bringing some of his veggie garden burgers. Eric showed up in some surfer shorts with no shirt tugging bags of ice. I would kill to see Eric get waxed. If Eric gained about 100 pounds, he could look like "" George the Animal Steel with all that fur!!! I think the best part of the day was to see Cheryl Boyce Taylor show up. She is sooooo genuine and loving. Seeing her there enjoying all the food and laughs is what made the day great for me. I took the first shift at cooking and it was pretty cool. I volunteered to "" chef it out "" and I don't mind that. The best part were those pork chops. OH man, enough spices to make your mouth water. When the food was done, I made the "" Pig yell "" (Soooooooooweeeeeeeeeeeeeee ) and everyone grabbed a plate. The second shift was a joint effort between Eric, Raymond, and Oscar. I was done cooking and the smell of smoke got me pretty much drained. Funny thing was when eric was grilling and the whole grill caught fire and he tried to save the meat. He looked like an extra from the movie "" Backdraft "" trying to save dying kids from the raging inferno. Either that or one great blunder waiting to happen. He managed to save the meat and all was well at The "" bbq "" . I had to make my exit about 6:30 pm. I would love to have stayed to enjoy the food and maybe even help with the clean-up. Thing is, the 4th of July is not a good holiday for me. I went through some shit years ago and the 4th of July has opened a flood gates of emotions. I have always managed to hide my emotions very well. The 4th is a year in which I have to hide them the hardest. I lost it the year after my accident and every year after has been a task. I have gotten better but I still tend to get very mellow. People tend to always ask me what is wrong and I don't like being around people when I am kinda depressed. I don't even think of it as depression all the time. I think of it as just thinking too much. So my defense mechanism is just being alone. The BBQ was great and it was really like the first time that I hung out with these people like this. I hope that many more days will follow. I saw T3 ( terminator 3 ) this morning. It was a pretty good movie. Very action filled. Take care and be well Peace, Love Fish >)))"">"

She was dizzy and hot.She decided to sit down and stretch her legs out on the couch that she and her friends had claimed for the night. They were lucky they were friends with the waiter. He saved them a spot because he knew they'd be here tonight. Her 2 friends went to the bathroom. They needed to freshen up before they all went back to dancing the night away. She didn't care to go. She was too drunk. She was trying to keep her eyes open. But she couldn't see much. Two guys who were facing the other direction were blocking her view of the dancefloor. As if sensing her stare, one of the guys looked around, and said something. She signaled that she couldn't hear him. It was the music. Too loud. And the buzz in her head was making it hard to concentrate. 'May I sit here,' he asked again. She could smell him. Unlike this whole place which smelled of sweating bodies, he smelled like a fresh bath and CK1. She nodded her head and looked away. He was not good-looking at all. Yech, she thought to herself. She smiled. As if she was any better to look at tonight. Her friends came back. And they snuck in between them (the guy was now talking animatedly to his friend who was looking at her). And they went back to dancing. A bottle of Red Horse later, she was sitting beside the guy. And he was asking her for her number. She laughed. She was impressed because he had grace. But it was also very funny because she'd be leaving the country in less than a month. And he was not her type. But he spoke in clear english in a low tone that made her think he was the most sincere person in the room. Or maybe it was the beer. She decided to just continue to let loose and dance the night away. She came into the club, thinking she was invisible and as thin as air. She got out of there with a glimmer of hope in the invincible something. And, outside the club, he looked a bit more attractive than she gave him credit for. And he still smelled good. That was a start."

Photographers are not primarily interested in photographs. They have a focused energy and enthusiasm which is directed at an outside, physically present, other. They bring to this subject an exaggerated sense of curiosity, backed up by knowledge gleaned from reading, writing, talking, note taking. 2. The photographer transmits this passion in ""the other itself"" by making pictures, therefore the subject must lend itself to a visual medium, as opposed to, say, writing about it. 3. The photographer must assiduously practice his/her craft so that there is no technical impediment bewteen realizing the idea and transmitting it through the final print. 4. The photographer must have the ability to analyze the components of the subject-idea so that a set of images not only reflects the basic categories but also displays visual variety. Intense, clear thinking is a prerequisite to fine photography. 5. The photographer is aware that, like all difficult endeavors, to be good at photography requires an unusual capacity for continuous hardwork and.......... Good Luck!

doc01311,6,"This is an acutal review posted by someone on Aint it Cool New of the new Matrix movie, Reloaded ------- errr dont read if you havent seen the film :-) MATRIX: KINGDOM OF ASS-KICKING Jim-Jammity Jesus Krispy Kreme Christ on a twat-rocket, this movie blew me apart and put me back together only after I�d got put back I felt like I had thirteen dicks and they�d all gotten blown by a surfer chick with 26 heads (2 mouths on each cock). I will see it ten times and if I see Star Wars George or that gay Batman director butt-hole any time during the ten screenings here comes Mr. Punch. This is the sequel to the MATRIX Movie that came out four years ago and after seeing it I can say I could have waited another four years it is that fucking good. This movie is a pillowcase with soda cans inside that beats the living mule-fuck out of you but you�re all like, �Bring it on honky tonk� because the beating feels like summer and Halloween and Cheetos at the same time. This movie is Mad Max�s shotgun-gun from ROAD WARRIOR, only it shoots ass-kicking only at jocks. This movie is tits! WARNING: THIS PARAGRAPH IS ABOUT THE PLOT AND IT�S BORING AND THERE�S NO ASS-KICKING IN IT BUT I USE THE WORD �FUCK� THREE TIMES TO HELP GET THROUGH IT I still don�t get the plot of the first one, and this one�s all talking about �choices� (over and over again to where you think you�re watching that fucking Chicktime network) and �prophecies� and especially words like �anomaly� and �exile� (and who the fuck even knows what those words mean?) and there�s this long speech at the end that I also didn�t get. Also, you find out all this deep stuff, like about The Cookie Lady from the first movie and they introduce all these other characters like a Key Guy and a Frenchie Dude and another Frenchie but guess what it�s okay �cuz the other Frenchie�s a chick and she�s got cleavage you could hide a rump roast in and also this ex-girlfriend of Murphus and there�s this new guy on the ship flying it around, I think he�s from OZ (don�t worry, no butt rape). And Neo and Memento Babe are all PDA every second, and they also �do it� and one time I thought I saw Memento Babe�s nip but it was one of those metal ring things that everyone�s got on �em so no jacking off when the DVD comes out. NOW ALL ASS-KICKING UNTIL THE END So that�s the plot but here�s the thing: you could wear headphones and listen to Dio during this whole movie and you wouldn�t miss anything, there� s so much ass-kicking going on. That Smith Dude is back, only now he can make more Smith Dudes and do they each know how to kick ass? Like a Heroclix collector knows how to not get pussy. Plus he�s got this other ability that� s really fucking scary and I think it might have something to do with the next movie. ASS-KICKING #1: Neo fights those Blues Brothers-looking dudes and it�s pretty fucking cool. But it�s just a teaser, like when they have pictures of the food at Jack in the Box, and the tacos look all good in the picture, but then you get some and they look like they got pooped out of a pig. But you eat �em because there�s fries coming. In this movie there�s ALWAYS fries coming. 6. HEADS UP: There�s a lot of boring stuff between Ass-Kicking 1 and 2. There�s a sermon by the dude who was in OMEGA MAN, and this underground dance thing that looks like if Pottery Barn had a rave on the Planet of the Gay Apes � but the rave thing is where Neo and Memento Babe �do it�. I am bringing my headphones when I see this again on the 15th. ASS-KICKING #2: Neo and a Kung Fu Phooey go at it in a picnic restaurant. They kick over a big thing of chopsticks, which is kind of cool, and Kung Fu Phooey wears these cool little sunglasses, but that�s it. 5. And then Neo and Cookie Lady talk. Then chiggity-check your rectum �cuz here comes: ASS-KICKING #2: This fight on a playground where like a hundred Smith Dudes are whomping on Neo like a fat girl eating Fiddle Faddle � it�s that intense. Holy shit. The thing goes on for like five minutes and just when you�re thinking, �Fuck you Star Wars George� it goes on for another five minutes and then Neo flies away like that Greatest American Hero dude. 10. ASS-KICKING #3: Neo, Murphus and Memento Babe go to a French restaurant in the Matrix and there�s this French dick and you�re thinking, �Fuck you for not supporting us against Egypt�, and then Neo goes whomp-ass happy on the dude�s cohorts while Murphus and Trinity free this Key Dude and fight these Edgar Winter guys with dreadlocks who can turn into ghosts. 8. HERE�S WHERE I WISH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ONLY HAD THE WORDS �HOLY� �FUCKING� AND �SHIT� ASS-KICKING #4 � 28: That�s right, this next scene feels like 24 ass-kickings. Seriously, the rest of the summer is going to suck busboy cock for ketchup packets compared to this scene. HOLY Murphus and Memento Babe have to escape on a huge freeway (which is a no-no in the Matrix; �It�s suicide!� says Memento Babe, or something like that I can�t remember for sure) while the Ghost Guys chase them, plus the Smiths, who keep taking over the drivers on the freeway and they�re shooting and everything�s blowing up for miles and FUCKING Memento Babe has to go against the traffic on a fucking motorcycle and they keep trying to smash her and Murphus takes out the Ghost Guys in this totally cool way and the fucking samurai sword and the head-on crash and !!!SHIT!!! the fucking Blues Brothers guys and razors and swordfight on top of a truck and Memento Babe flying through the air and out of nowhere Neo and I am out!!of!!cum!! 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 And there�s a whole other ass-kicking after this, which I can barely remember because, seriously, that fucking chase scene. It�s now #2 on my list of all-time chases, ahead of ARK RAIDERS, where Blade Runner gets dragged behind the Nazi truck (#5), and then DYING IN LOS ANGELES, where CSI is driving the car against the traffic (#4) and then TAXI RONIN, where Taxi Driver guy goes the wrong way down that French tunnel, and also because they keep running over French people (#3), and now MATRIX, right behind BANDIT AND THE FAT GAY GUY 2, where all the police cars and all the trucks play chicken out in the desert (#1). Neo needs to fight Blade and that fat bald guy from STIR CRAZY. Then Murphus and Neo and Memento Babe try to raid some sort of central something, like the CPU in TRON, something like that. Smith Dude re-appears, Neo has a talk with a new character, someone dies and someone�s reborn. Then something gets destroyed (good), something else gets destroyed (bad), and Neo discovers a new power. Then something BIG gets destroyed (really really bad), and someone lives who shouldn�t. MY HINT: Stay through the credits and you get to see a trailer for MATRIX: YOU WILL SHIT, the third movie. That�s it. Best movie of the year. I still want to see HULK-MAN and the werewolf thing and I think there�s something where you get to see a hot Asian�s boobs, but they�re not going to get close to this one. Here�s my blurb if they�re putting blurbs in ads: �MATRIX: KINGDOM OF ASS-KICKING is like if all of Anthrax�s albums formed into a hot chick who had to fuck you ten times a day or she gets pee-cancer.�"

So we got to talking, and well, if I had to be shallow for a moment, I figure there's guys out there who, unfortunately, don't have much, therefore give up, and prolly never get laid. Then there's guys who don't have much, but know what they're doing, and they're not attractive (whether it be physically or mentally). The guy who's doing well in the package department, know's what to do with it, but is convieniently ""unavailable""... and the guy who definately has something but don't know what the hell to do with it.

doc01316,5,"Usually, it's not a good idea to follow your impulses. Case in point: Today me and Chris went to about 30 Garage Sales. At the first one we came to, there was a big box of Halloween costumes. We ended up buying these dress/tunic type things, mine green, Chris black. Then things got a little out of hand and we added masks, a bunch of watches, and plastic baseball bats. Long story short, my mom pulls up and me and Chris start banging on her windows with the baseball bats, yelling ""Respect! Respect! Respect!"" This story didn't really go where I had planned, but that's ok. There was an Xbox thing tonight but I didn't go. I just didn't have the patience to sit through four hours of bad jokes while starting at a little TV in a hot room. I went to Troy last night, with Chris and the Hobster. Except Bryce ended up actually seeing Troy and Hobie went to Van Helsing. I don't know why this happened, but me and Chris were confused about Hobie's actions. So we wrote an as-of-yet untitled song about Hobie. One reason I will be happy when school is out is that I am really sick of seeing everybody every day. I got this really awesome 35mm camera today for a dollar. I think the lady gave me a discount because she called my tunic a dress. Chris got a turntable. I need to clean my car out and wash it. We were going to do that today, but you know, the tunics and the bats were too much fun. I like going places with Chris because he connects with people almost everywhere he goes. He seems like a real person to them. Even Schilling likes Chris. I think the only people who don't like him are elitests who think they are better than everyone. I don't like people who keep their disdain on the inside. Next week is the last week of school. Only problem, I've got that Gatsby essay to write, and I have no idea where to start. I'm pretty sure I have a high English grade, so I'll probably just slap something together on Thursday night and cross my fingers. Did you enjoy music this weekend? I know I did. I always do.

doc01317,2,"For the third time this week, I heard yet another person use the term mockumentry in referance to F911 . Theses Bush supporting columnists and comentators use this title siting that Moore simply used this film to further his own political agenda. To those conservatives I would like to say... WELL DUH! Of course he did. He isn't pretending to present a non bias interpretation of the facts. Moore is sternly anti-Bush. But, just because he uses his art form to further a message he strongly believes in doesn't make this a ""mock-u-mentry"". Documentries use non fiction footage to tell a story. The director or creator decides what story he wants to tell before he starts filming. Hopefully his vision slightly changes or grows as he learns things along the way. If there is no story, there is no film, there is no point. Documentries are an artistic expression, they are NOT non bias journalistic video pieces . Some directors might choose to attempt a non bias movie, but there will always be an opposing opinion. I'm sure many revisionists consider the numerous holocoust documentries pure Zionist proganda. A mockumentry is a fictional and often comedic film shot in the style of a documentry. The definative genre piece is Spinal Tap . Christopher Guest has gone on to define this genre with brilliant improv skills of his friends including the films Waiting for Guffman , Best in Show , and most recently, A Mighty Wind . A different take can be that of the Blair Witch Project which was marketed as ""real"" to amp up the fear factor when it was clearly false. If F911 was a mockumentry, it wouldn't be using real footage of president Bush golfing. This are real images. It would most likely take a Bush-a-like (might i suggest Will Ferrel) and purposely put him in slapstick situations with befuddling improvised dialogue. F911 is not that movie. Before you bring out your ""expert"" perhaps someone in the news business to refute my defination, I studied and am degreed in film. Documentries are film, not news. The same rules, the same criticisms of bias, do not and should not apply. Simply disagreeing with the subject matter of a documentry or even the validity of the point of view of a documentry does not make it a Mockumentry."

doc01319,4,"Yesterday afternoon, the truly execrable Mike Phlegming had County Sheriff Mark Luttrell on his radio show to discuss County Mayor AC Wharton's ""doomsday"" budget. Luttrell was remarkably calm about it, and really gave the sense (though not the admission) that he's in on the bluff. He deferred politely to the Mayor's decision and kept telling listeners that it was to be expected when there would be no tax increase. It only reinforces my belief that this is nothing but a lawyer's tactic to get the County Commission to acquiesce to the Mayor's original budget with the 23 cent tax increase. You keep watching. As for Phlegming, he was his typical annoying self. At one point, Mike asked Luttrell a question about something ""his sources"" had told him about: a two page memo about some internal County decisions leading up to the budget. (I'm going from memory, so I may have that a bit wrong.) You could tell that Mike was trying to trap Luttrell into something without spilling beans over the air. Nothing was revealed except that Fleming knows things you don't and wants you to know it.

doc01335,5,"I just did a variation of some Peter Carrol-esque method of gaining gnosis. To be honest the results were pretty frightening, but the joy of it actually working seems to cover it up. I intentionally tried to shut off my psyche, and it worked more or less. The problem with not having any rational thought is that nothing really goes into memory. I did the process twice because I barely remember the first time. It was in short, me straining my arms first, and then getting light headed, and then tensing all my muscles towards my lungs and then standing up and whhooosh. I'm out. It was alot like how we'd pass out at camp, but this time it had a purpose. I remember thinking as I held my breath and lay on the bed that it wasn't working. Then something, something I couldn't remember the insant I regained consciousness. It was something in a circle of blackness both times, and I know it was something material, but because of the fact that my normal brain processes weren't going on I retained none of it, other then knowing something important happened. Pretty strange, and apparently not the way to retain much of anything. Anyone who does weed, should try it, and see if it's anything like it."

I got to grab Andrew's curly hair (FRO BOY!) and yell at Josh, and our subsitute was a really annoying woman named Ms. Leech. How ironic... So then we go outside (Amanda and I) and I say good bye to Chris (and show Amanda my boyfriend! LoL) and Nicole O. walks by, Josh right behind her before he stops to say bye to us. Then he asks Nicole if she is ignoring us on purpose. So she turns around and says, ""Amanda doesn't like me anymore."" Hah. My cue. I just can't seem to keep my mouth shut. ""She never liked you in the first place."" Whoa, how did that slip out? No idea. So she blushes and walks away and Amanda and Josh burst out laughing.

At Sexy Tomatoes! Grrrls kick ass and we're going to prove it! So, while Im busy writing my first post for Sexy Tomatoes on the joys of female orgasm, I will leave you with this tantalizing piece, submitted to me via email. I didn’t write this, it was sent to me by another blogger…. Im not sure if he wants credit or not, so I will let him decide in the comments…. How to please your man with Oral Sex Lesson 1 -- The Basics The most important thing about sucking a man's cock (or anything else sexual, in my opinion) is to be totally into it. You have to convince him that you absolutely adore what you're doing, can't get enough of it, would die without it. Be dirty, filthy, a slut, a whore (but a high class, expensive one, of course, willing to give it to him for free, just this once). After all, most guys' ideas about sex were formed by watching porn movies -- you may want to check a few out to get the hang of what men fantasize about. But the main thing is, make love to his cock, worship it...don't act like you're just trying to get it over with. You have to get inside his head, fuck his brain while your sucking his cock. Look up at him a lot, whenever you can, with your best ""fuck me"" look (c'mon girls, you know how to do that!). Tell him with your eyes how hot this makes you, and how much you're enjoying it. Lesson 2 -- Foreplay You really want to take your time with this part...a nice, slow build-up will pay big dividends later. Look at him and ever so slowly circle your lips with your tongue. Then take a nice long trip around his body with your mouth, your tongue, your hands, your breasts...play with his nipples, his bellybutton, his inner thighs, his fingers, his toes, anything and everything. I particularly like licking and sucking on a middle finger, very suggestively, eyes locked on his. Move your mouth to his ear, breathe hotly, lash your tongue around inside....and then whisper something slow and shocking, like ""I'm gonna suck you off...."". When you finally arrive between his legs, stay away from his cock at first. Concentrate first on his balls, licking them, sucking them gently into your mouth, getting them nice and wet. When you're ready, begin tracing up and down the shaft with your tongue, or nibble on it with your lips. Flick your tongue against it quickly for a change of pace...there's a niiiiiice sensitive spot just below the head, on the underside. Sometimes he'll get a little droplet of pre-cum on the tip of his cock...it's fun to play with it, touching it with your tongue and pulling away. Maybe a little silvery strand of it will come away with your tongue. Nibble for awhile on the head with your lips before you suck him into your mouth....circle it lazily with your tongue. Some men think it's sexy if you kind of slap it wetly against your outstretched tongue, or you can rub it around on your face. You might also slide his dick between your breasts, moving up and down on it, pressing them together with your hands. Lesson 3 -- Wetness Never forget, everything should be wet, wet, wet!! Saliva everywhere! His cock should be dripping and glistening with moisture. Your mouth and lips and cheeks and hair should be wet. I think it's sexy sometimes to let saliva drip down from your mouth onto the head of his cock, and then stroke it with your hand, or just slurp it back into your mouth. If you're really feeling nasty, you can even spit on it and then attack it with your mouth, sucking him quick and hard...this is fun sometimes and helps get across the impression that you're being driven absolutely insane with lust, in grave danger of losing control, rushing out the door, and offering to fuck every male on the planet! Lesson 4 -- No Teeth! In my experience, most guys don't like teeth marks on their prized possessions. Maybe a playful little nibble now and then, but mostly, I think your mouth should feel like a nice, tight, wet pussy, only better (after all, your vagina doesn't have a tongue in it and can't suck on him as nicely as your mouth can). So open your mouth wide and purse your lips around him...guys love the sight of your lips pressed around him and you cheeks hollowing as his hard cock slides in and out of your mouth, your tongue teasing him on each stroke. Look up at him and treat him to the sight of his massive, throbbing cock buried in your face, your lips stretched tightly around it. Lesson 5 -- Rhythm Another key, once you really get down to business, is to establish a nice, steady rhythm, in and out, in and out, in and out....Not too fast, take your time, but set a pace and stick to it. Let him know that you don't care how long it takes....you'd love to suck his cock until hell freezes. After awhile you can gradually accelerate. Make nice, wet slurping noises as you suck him. By the way, you don't have to take him too deep at first, but most guys seem to like it so you might want to practice a little. Personally, I don't mind letting him nudge the back of my throat a little. Moving your fingers and/or fingernails on the shaft in rhythm with your sucking is also nice if your mouth is too small to take him deeply. This is one time when smaller cocks have they're advantages! Lesson 6 -- Tease!! Don't you dare let him cum too soon! You have to TEASE!! If you think he's getting close (most guys are dead giveaways -- they're thighs tremble), ease off, take him out of your mouth, and flick your tongue against the head of his cock, looking up and smiling teasingly....or you can nibble on the shaft, tickle or suck on his balls, almost anything. This will give your jaw muscles time to relax, in case you were wondering. This is also another good time to take him between your breasts...or you can rub the head of his cock against your nipples (mine are always as hard as pebbles at this point!) When he calms down a bit, you can pick up where you left off. Make a game out of it....se if you can get him to a fever pitch, just on the brink of cumming, and keep him there as long as you can, ready to explode like a geyser! But above all, stay in control. Don't let him grab your head and start fucking your mouth (that's the subject of an advanced lesson!) Let him know that you're in charge, that you won't disappoint him, and that his reward is coming, so to speak. You can taunt him with your voice, too....ask him if he wants to cum, or if he likes what you're doing to him. Or just give him little moans and gasps now and then, to make him think you're about to cum yourself just from sucking him off (I almost did once, I swear!). Lesson 7 -- Don't Forget the Nether Region Some guys will deny this, but most males love to have a girl play around with their butts. During foreplay, if you're the adventurous type and he's squeaky clean, you can lick around his asshole or even stiffen your tongue and do a little gentle (or not so gentle) probing. When you suck on his cock, a wet finger easing into his ass can work wonders...but you may want to save this for the....uh....moment of truth. Some guys go right over the edge just from the thought that the girl he always thought was so sweet and innocent could be so incredibly nasty! Lesson 8 -- The Grand Finale Once you've teased him until he's literally begging for mercy, it's time for the main event! I like to release him at this point, look into his eyes adoringly, and whisper in no uncertain terms exactly what I'm about to do. Tell him something like ""I want you to cum"", or ""I want to taste you""....accentuate every syllable. Or ask him if he'd like to cum in your mouth, or all over your face, or wherever. Don't mince words. Now, you can be aggressive...plunge your mouth down on him, suck him hard and fast...use your hands, your fingers, squeeze his balls, tease is asshole, or slide that finger into him....in short, pull out all the stops. He's utterly helpless, he can't stop you, all he can do is let it happen. And don't be afraid....this is the best part, that feeling at the moment his balls tighten up, filled with hot cum, and his cock lurches and expands suddenly in your mouth, and his whole body is taut like a bowstring! I always hear a drum roll in my head at this point. Lesson 9 -- The Truth about Cum I have never met a man who wasn't convinced that his cum was a combination of honey, facial cream, and the nectar of the gods. You must think of it the same way. You crave it, must have it, will kill for it, the more the merrier! You want to drown in it, play in it, let it cover you, all hot, creamy and sexy. As for the taste, it really doesn't taste like much...kind of salty, maybe, but not offensive. No matter....as far as he knows, you think it's absolutely heavenly! He may want to cum in your mouth, and that's OK (I'm assuming, by the way, that this guy is certifiably disease free...if he's not, you should never have gotten this far!). But most guys seem to get off on watching it spurt out on your face, on your tongue, in your hair, on your breasts, etc., etc. Soooo, give him what he wants, with a look of rapture on your sweet lips as his cum splashes on you, oozes down your chin, drips down onto your nipple. Grip his cock with one hand and stroke him rhthmically as he cums, unless he's already doing this himself (which is kinda sexy to watch). Some guys cum in big, thick, strong spurts (especially if you followed these instructions to the letter!), while in other cases, it might just kind of ooze out. The more he cums, the prouder he'll be of himself, so be appropriately awestruck at his monster load of love juice. Let your tongue play in it, swirl it around, collect it with your fingers, suck gobs of it into your mouth and then let it ooze out between your lips while you gaze up at him. You can swallow it if you want (after playing with it awhile) but you don't have to....just don't spit it out like it was disgusting or something. Lesson 10 -- The Aftermath As his orgasm subsides, you can suck him back into your mouth, but be gentle....he may be a bit sensitive at this point. Otherwise, content yourself with licking up any little traces of cum, or just lazily run your tongue up and down the shaft, or suck on his balls...take your time, don't be in a hurry. Leave his cum on your face, maybe running your tongue around your lips, licking at it or rubbing it with a finger. If he's half a man, he'll yank you up to him and shower you with kisses and tell you what a goddess you are. Just smile like the Mona Lisa and ask him innocently if he liked it.

doc01339,3,"I had fucked this guy a few months ago. His performance was so-so...a bit slower than I'd normally like, but the hottest thing on him was his mouth. And no, I don't mean him going down on me....I mean the guy would not shut up about me. He was telling me how long he's been wanting to fuck me (he said years), how I turned him on, and how he couldn't believe this was happening....the man was screaming MY name!! I didn't know how real that was, but damn it was hot!! It would be so cool if it was true, but I don't want to know....no guy has ever gone off like that in my life...let me tell you, oh, I felt extremely sexy for the next two weeks. Damn, I'm hot! Anyways, I knew he was moving to another state...so I figured bon voyage....Until I ran into him again a month ago (he is still moving, but he was really busy & thought I might be mad at him for not calling sooner)....he was buying me drinks and telling me how bummed he was that we had just hooked up &amp; he had to leave. He told me how he just wants to touch me.....kiss me....you name it. I point out that he's not gone yet & we have some time to have fun &amp; when he leaves....no regrets, no strings. He agrees (quite enthusiastically) and so I call him a couple of days later to see if he'd like to hook up. The fucker never calls me back. Just in case something came up....I gave him one more opportunity.....nope. Well, that happens, no commitments go both ways. Don't take it personally, I didn't want to date the guy &amp; hell, there's plenty more where he came from....plus, I reminded myself that his fucking was only....eh, if it wasn't for his glowing review of me. I ran into him last night. I'm friendly, civil, but distant when he starts flirting with me. And he is so flirting with me....and even though I drank a wee bit too much, I am still simply friendly. When I was leaving, he says goodbye, then he says, ""You bother me, Miss Macy."" I ask, ""I bother you? How's that?"" His line: ""You are so cool....you bother me because I am leaving. Why did I have to find out just how cool you are?"" ""So, that's why you never called me, cause I am so cool, it bothers you."" I think he's really trying to tell me he'll get attached to me....but then again....I dunno. ""Yeah. You are the coolest girl I have met in a really, really long time....and I have to leave, but will you call me before I leave?"" ""Sure."" Yeah, you hold your breath til I call. If he was telling the truth....that'd rock. For me anyway."

doc01341,1,That is some funny shit. I had some tears going.
doc01342,1,"The holiday weekend was fun. My brother drove the entire way to and back, so it wasn't that hard for me. So for the life of me, I can't figure out why I'm so tired. School's winding down. I realize that my very first Illustrator drawing of Yakko is completely lost since I never saved it on my home computer and I deleted it off my Yahoo briefcase. I can only hope that it was saved on my student folder at school. I mean, it wasn't that hard to do (it took about an hour and half) but I don't want to do it over again. Anyway, my Illustrator class is ending this week (well, we're taking the final this week, at least) and she wanted us to take our projects and make it into a website. Shrek 2 is a great movie. I liked the first one better, but mainly cuz it's hard to tell a story after the happily ever after. But it is sooo funny, chock-full of jokes. Antonio Banderas's Puss-in-Boots was there mainly for comic relief more than a plot device, but he was funny. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the kingdom of Far Far Away ws hy-larious. Especially Farbucks. Heh heh. I had an interesting discussion with my bro-in-law over the weekend about tips. Do I think I deserve my tips? The answer is yes. But not because I'm providing any better service than to those who do not tip. But because they don't pay me enough so that the tips make up for the wages they should be paying me. I think I need a better job. But what other job out there is as flexibly scheduled with an equal or higher pay (plus benefits)? My schedule for this week: Tue -- school Wed -- 11:45 am to 4 pm Thu -- school Fri -- 2:45 to 9 pm Sat -- 8 pm to 12:15 am Sun -- 4:30 to 11:15 pm"

Another of the Bush Administration's dirty little secrets is coming to light in the form of prisoner who was secretly held in an Iraqi prison for nearly nine months. Apparently at the request of former CIA Director George Tenet, the so-called ""high value target"" was secreted away on orders from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. urlLink 'Triple X' , as the prisoner was code-named, was not assigned an internment identification as is required under international law. Nor was his presence disclosed to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Department of Defense officials say his secret status was supposed to be temporary and deny he was a ghost detainee. The official reason given: the CIA and the Pentagon "" dropped the ball "" by failing to review his status for more than eight months despite two requests by low-level military personnel to reclassify the prisoner, and integrate him into the general prison population.

doc01348,2,"urlLink Email urlLink Got to talking to a co-worker today about a buddy of mine who is in the Army and currently stationed in Iraq. I have mentioned this fine young lad before, and his name is Matt Sanders, known to those of us who love him as Sanders, Sanchez, The Right Honorable Sanchez Maxton (he's very exciting), or the preferable, simple, Chez. Chez is a man of much laughter. Infectious laughter. Rollicking if you get him going. It's a sight to see. Watch the women and children if you get him near a movie with any kind of anal expulsion comedy, as there is every chance he will one day explode. In any event, whenever we get together here in good 'ol PA--times that are, quite sadly, fewer and further between these days--we rehash every sweet story from high school. They get Chez rolling. You know it's a good night when all the drunk people at the bar are staring at the four or five idiots (usually consisting of myself; Chez; T. Richardson Brown, Banker; Patty; and Princeton Andy) mucking up epics such as The Perfect College Bowl System, The Pat Gahr Special, The Time Geoff Nearly Got An Ass-Whipping From the Entire Steel-High Starting Five With Support by the Bench as His Friends Left Him for Dead, and countless others. Most of them would be funny to only the few of us. Most of them. Really, all but two. In honor of my conversation about my good friend today, I will present the following two stories. One directly involves Chez; the other is simply his favorite Cedar Cliff Flashback of All Time. He told me over Christmas break that he would be out in the field, doing some kind of military exercise with other Armyans, and think about this story, which sent him into fits of laughter that he could not accurately explain to his unenlightened companions. This brought about much joy. To go a bit further, any sweet story I relay to you all will now be filed under a new GooseTown Subsection... THE CHRONICLES OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE SANCHEZ MAXTON (HE'S VERY EXCITING) Chapter One, Epic I - We Can Only Hope the Desk Calendar Survived Senior Year, circa 1997. Chez is halfway, kinda-sorta dating one of our girl friends. She is a bit standoffish. He takes her to Homecoming; she summarily dismisses any attention he gives her both at the dance and at the after-party, at the house of a girl named Beth Betherson* (EDITOR'S NOTE: The names are changed not because I care but because I do not want to get sued. Even though that would be wicked sweet .) Chez is honestly the nicest kid in the entire world, and it would take a hell of a lot for him to ditch anyone, let alone a girl he took to Homecoming. But there's beer, she's pissing him off, and he does so. Long story short, the kid ends up not only banging the hell out of the hottest girl at the Cliff, Stephanie Stepherson, but doing it in Mr. Betherson's office. I do not find this out until someone brings it up by accident that Monday at our lunch table. I proceed to stand, clap, then sit and bang my fists on the lunch table chanting, ""SANDERS! SANDERS!"" until Tony Carozza (Sean Connery V.2) asks me what the hell is going on. Fast forward to the break immediately following Homeroom that Friday. There is a fall sports Pep Rally that afternoon. The aforementioned T. Richardson Brown, Banker is Student Council President and therefore must introduce each and every member of each Fall Sports Team at said event. He has to throw in some nicknames. Chez is on the soccer team. Stephanie is on the field hockey team. They'll be on the floor at the same time. The whole school knows what had transpired. Naturally, this is a f*cking Potential Kodak Moment if there ever was one. It was right in front of us, and we just called it out; it was on the tip of everyone's tongue--we just gave it a name. Betwixt T. Rich and myself, we decided he would introduce Chez as "" Matt 'I Do My Best Work in the Office' Sanders"". F*cking brilliant, right? God I love this story. Fast forward to lunch. Banker approaches me in a panic. ""It's a no go on the Sanders thing,"" he tells me. The faculty liaison to Student Council (her name slips my mind at the moment) nabbed him in the hall and told him the reference to Chez was inappropriate and was not to be used, lest he risk disciplinary action. One thought crosses our minds--how in glorious f*ck could the FACULTY have found out about this? There was no reasonable connection. Befuddling. Pure insanity. They know. Trevor spends the rest of the day up until the Pep Rally sweating the decision as whether or not to use the verbage we so creatively...eh, created. Pep Rally. Packed gymnasium. This was back when people cared about our Cedar Cliff and the sports teams were excelling. Trevor is doing his introductions. The announcement of Stephanie brings a few cat calls but nothing serious. Then we move to the Boy's Soccer Team. The tension is mounting...especially in my stomach. If banker has the balls, this is one for the books. Publicly defiling an otherwise innocent girl and sending a big F*ck You to The Man. He's calling them off...I can barely contain myself...we're three away from Chez...blind people with Parkinson's have had better luck trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel than I am having holding in my excitement...Chez is up...he begins to walk on the floor...Banker starts, ""Next, eh, we have...uhhhhhhhhhh...""...this is it, g*ddamnit, I can feel it...""Matt......"" I'm coherent only of the fact that I'm standing and applauding before Banker spits out the fastest sentence in the History of American English: ""...IDoMyBestWorkintheOfficeSANDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Absolute. F*cking. Mayhem. Everyone goes NUTS. I mean crazy. Standing, cheering, whistling. To that point, it's the best moment of my life, and I'm not even the one that got laid. The faculty are in disbelief. Banker looks like he has been arrested for anally raping a midget in the middle of Toys 'R Us. Pure Glory. I wish you could see the smile on my face--then and now. Stephanie is taking it quite well, not hiding behind her hands or running off the floor. Remember the goosebumps you got at the end of The Shawshank Rdemption ? Multiply it by a hundred. And Chez lives on as immortal to this day. Chapter One, Epic II - Did He Really Think Accosting the Lunch Lady Would Solve the Problem? I moved to Cedar Cliff when I was 15, in tenth grade, and knew only four people. They were all two years older than me, and one had been a family friend since the day I was born. Luckily, I had his lunch, and was able to position myself in a seat at one of the Senior Tables that year. The players: myself, Spencer Haller, Steve Clark, family friend Donald T. Gray Jr., Mike Brennan, and perhaps someone else. We had these Friendly's Ice Cream Cups in the lunch line. They were damn good, as anyone who has enjoyed Friendly's Ice Cream might imagine them to be. There was one fatal flaw to them, however: the cream in the cup was fabulous, but it was covered in a hard disc of chocolate and whatever candy was the marquee in the dessert (usually M&M's, not that it matters). Most people just cut around the disc and went right for the ice cream; the chocolate was like cement and far too hard to eat, let alone work into the main attraction. You would find them all over the halls after each lunch period. Kids actually assaulted their friends with these sugary weapons. Poor John Rodnick was once sent to the hospital and received four stitches after an errant Flying Chocostar hit his temple. It was terrible. OK, I made that last part up. I digress. There was one day a month when the school served Sweet Potatoes at lunch. Don't ask me why, I couldn't tell you any more than I read Chinese. It made no sense then and it makes less now. No one ate them. They were a horrible orange color that always reminded me of cat vomit. This particular day, Mr. Clark decided to get a cup of Friendly's. He removed the cap of Petrified M&M Conglomeration from the top, ate his ice cream, and sat contently. In what would become an iconic moment in my life, he lazily set the chocolate disc back in place in the top portion of the now-empty cup. It fit in, snug as ever, and gave the appearance that it had never been touched, ice cream still waiting beneath. I think my eyes may have lit up first, but Spencer was the one who spoke: ""Steve, give me your tray."" Steve slid it over, and the magic began to unfold. Spencer packed as many Sweet Potatoes into the cup as he could, mashing them further down with a spoon. He then placed the disc back on top. Like a f*cking glove. You couldn't tell it had been touched. We all stared, dumbfounded--how could anyone have ignored the potential for so long? After a few minutes of debate involving flawless execution of Parliamentary Procedure, it was decided that Steve would place the Friendly's cup back in the freezer in the lunch line. He stood, looked around casually, and walked to the front of the cafeteria. Had anyone been watching the front of the large room it would have been over. But everyone one served, there was no reason to look that way, and no one was paying Steve any attention. He calmly slipped into the door to the nook where the freezers were, took another quick look around, and placed The Cup (as it has become known) back inside. When he got back to the table we exchanged a few high fives. We figured that we'd hear a story from either Third Lunch that day or First Lunch the following about someone getting duped. If we could have only known how perfectly our plan would unfold. Minutes later, a kid everyone affectionately called ""Dirt"" walked up to the Lunch Line. He emerged from the serving nook with a cup of Friendly's Ice Cream. Steve was first to notice. ""Holy sh*t. Holy sh*t. Dirt's got The Cup."" We swerved to look. Steve had placed a small dent in the side of the cup, just in case. What a brilliant Just In Case it turned out to be. Dirt had the dented cup. The Cup. And he was paying for it. The poor Lunch Lady had no idea what was about to unfold. We were silent with anticipation. A strange smile had burned itself on my face. Spencer broke the void with careful advice: ""Jesus Christ, don't let him see you looking at him."" Dirt took The Cup back to his table. As luck would have it, my view of Dirt, at his table, was wholly unobstructed. Donnie, Brennan and I could all see what was happening, and Steve and Spencer had to rely on our play-by-play. Here is what I remember clearly: the whole scene played out like the most well-scripted scene ever in a movie. Dirt sat with The Cup, talking and laughing with his friends, paying no attention to The Cup as he opened it, exposing the replaced Chocolate Disc. Steve and Spencer were begging for action (""He's...yeah, he's got it open...I can't...I can't believe it, he hasn't noticed...he's not even looking...Oh God, OH GOD!""). Steve couldn't take it and turned, looking directly at the table. Spencer was half a second behind him. We watched as Dirt, distracted by the friendly (no pun intended) banter of his lunch table, drove his oversized spoon into the chocolate disc (apparently, and good for us, he was not wise to the ways of its popular extraction) and it emerged with a speck of brown and a massive underbelly of sweet, sweet orange Sweet Potato. I think I began to weep softly as he placed the massive bite into his mouth, chewing down once, twice, thir... MASSIVE projectile expectoration. A very tiny yet angry Dirt jumped to his feet. ""What the F*CK IS THIS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!"" We watched in simultaneous shock and rapture as Dirt hightailed it for the inevitable scapegoat, the lunch lady. He let off with a string of obscenities that has yet to be matched by any Sailor of the High Seas. Faculty Lunch Chaperones had to restrain him, calm him down. I can recall only two things: 1. I laughed so hard I nearly blew a hole in my large intestine, and I'm not kidding. 2. I never got the hell out of a lunchroom faster. Stuff of legend. How could it have worked so splendidly, without a single hitch? To this day I can't answer that, I can only be glad I was there. Hope you enjoyed. There will be future yarns, and hopefully son I'll have the chance to run them by Chez during an Editorial Meeting in the Greater Harrisburg area. Come home safe, friend. Godspeed."
