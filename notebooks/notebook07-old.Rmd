## Amazon Product Classification

In these notes we will look a data set of product reviews from Amazon. Reviews
come from one of three different categories (Books, Films, and Food); the
classification task we will investigate is the classification of items into
one of these three categories.

```{r, message = FALSE}
set.seed(1)

amazon <- read_csv("data/amazon_product_class.csv") %>%
  mutate(train_id = if_else(runif(n()) < 0.6, "train", "valid"))
amazon
```

We will use a more sophisticated method for producing TF matrices and see how
to adapt our text classification methods for when there are more than two
categories.

### Natural language processing (NLP)

As we did in the previous notes, we will use the **cleanNLP** package to split
the textual data into a format with one row for each token (word or punctuation
mark). Last time we used the **stringi** backend, which is fast but error-prone.
This time we will use a library called **spacy** for extracting linguistic
features from the text. Running this backend can be done with the following
code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cnlp_init_spacy("en_core_web_sm")
token <- cnlp_annotate(amazon)$token
```

However, it requires having the Python library spacy already installed and set
up on your machine. It also can take a few minutes to finish parsing the text.
As an alternative, we will just load in the pre-computed data here (and I will
provide similar parsed data for the lab and projects):

```{r, message = FALSE}
token <- read_csv("data/amazon_product_class_token.csv.gz")
token
```

There is a lot of information that has been automatically added to this table,
the collective results of decades of research in computational linguistics and
natural language processing. Each row corresponds to a word or a punctuation
mark, along with metadata describing the token. Notice that reading down the
column `token` reproduces the original text. The columns available are:

- **doc_id**: A key that allows us to group tokens into documents and to link
back into the original input table.
- **sid**: Numeric identifier of the sentence number.
- **tid**: Numeric identifier of the token within a sentence. The first three
columns form a primary key for the table.
- **token**: A character variable containing the detected token, which is either
a word or a punctuation mark.
- **token_with_ws**: The token with whitespace (i.e., spaces and new-line
characters) added. This is useful if we wanted to re-create the original text
from the token table.
- **lemma**: A normalized version of the token. For example, it removes
start-of-sentence capitalization, turns all nouns into their singular form,
and converts verbs into their infinitive form.
- **upos**: The universal part of speech code, which are parts of speech that
can be defined in (most) spoken languages. These tend to correspond to the
parts of speech taught in primary schools, such as "NOUN", "ADJ" (Adjective),
and "ADV" (Adverb). The full set of codes and
their meaning can be found here:
[Universal POS tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/).
- **xpos**: A fine-grained part of speech code that depends on the specific
language (here, English) and models being used. You can find more information
here: [spaCy POS tags](https://spacy.io/api/annotation#pos-tagging)
- **tid_source** The token id of the word in the sentence that this token is
grammatically related to. Relations always occur within a sentence, so there is
no need for a seperate indication of the source **sid**.
- **relation**: The name of the relation implied by the **tid_source** variable.
Allowed relations differ slightly across models and languages, but the core set
are relatively stable. The codes in this table are
[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/en/dep/index.html).

There are many analyses that can be performed on the extracted features in this
table. We will look at a few here and expand on them over the next few weeks.

### Fitting a model

Before delving into the new variables in the tokens table, let's start by
replicating the analysis we did last time with the spam data for the Amazon
product category. Because this is a larger data set, we will set some additional
parameters to the `cnlp_utils_tf` function to include only those terms that are
in at least 0.1% of the corpus and no more than 50% of the corpus. We can also
set the maximum number of terms that will be included.

```{r}
X <- token %>%
  cnlp_utils_tf(doc_set = amazon$doc_id,
                min_df = 0.001,
                max_df = 0.5,
                max_features = 10000)

dim(X)
```

If there are more that `max_features` terms that fall between the allowed
frequencies, the most frequent of these will be used. As before, we will create
training data and run the glmnet function.

```{r}
X_train <- X[amazon$train_id == "train", ]
y_train <- amazon$category[amazon$train_id == "train"]

model <- cv.glmnet(
  X_train, y_train, alpha = 0.2, family = "multinomial", nfolds = 3
)
```

Like the spam model, our penalized regression does a very good job of
classifying products. The training set is nearly 99% accurate and the
validation set is 96.5% accurate.

```{r}
amazon %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(model, newx = X, type = "class")) %>%
  group_by(train_id) %>%
  summarize(class_rate = mean(category == pred))
```

Looking at a confusion matrix, we see that the few mistakes that do occur
happen when books and films are confused with one another. Can you think of
why this might happen?

```{r}
amazon %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(model, newx = X, type = "class")) %>%
  select(category, pred, train_id) %>%
  table()
```

Notice that each category has its own coefficients.

```{r}
temp <- coef(model, s = model$lambda[22])
beta <- Reduce(cbind, temp)
beta <- beta[apply(beta != 0, 1, any),]
colnames(beta) <- names(temp)
beta
```

You should see that the words that come out of the model match our intuition
for what words would be associated with each product type.

### POS tags

Now, let's see what we can do by making use of the part of speech tags in the
tokens data. To start, we can get a sense of the most common lemmas associated
with each universal part of speech:

```{r}
token %>%
  group_by(upos, lemma) %>%
  summarize(sm_count()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 8) %>%
  summarize(sm_paste(lemma))
```

Then, we can use these codes to filter the data to include only certain
parts of speech in our model. For example, we can look at only verbs:

```{r}
X <- token %>%
  filter(upos == "VERB") %>%
  cnlp_utils_tf(doc_set = amazon$doc_id,
                min_df = 0.001,
                max_df = 0.5,
                max_features = 10000)

dim(X)
```

The model has significantly fewer variables now. We then train the data as
before:

```{r}
X_train <- X[amazon$train_id == "train", ]
y_train <- amazon$category[amazon$train_id == "train"]

model <- cv.glmnet(
  X_train, y_train, alpha = 0.2, family = "multinomial", nfolds = 3
)
```

How well does the model do in predicting the category of the product? It's
okay, but not as good as the original model:

```{r}
amazon %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(model, newx = X, type = "class")) %>%
  group_by(train_id) %>%
  summarize(class_rate = mean(category == pred))
```

But keep in mind that our goal is not to find the most predictive model. Rather,
we want to use the predictive model to understand the data. Filtering on just
verbs does just that. We can, for example, see what verbs as associated with
each category:

```{r}
temp <- coef(model, s = model$lambda[14])
beta <- Reduce(cbind, temp)
beta <- beta[apply(beta != 0, 1, any),]
colnames(beta) <- names(temp)
beta
```

As with the first model matrix, most of these should seem reasonable to you
based on the categories.

### Dependencies

Dependencies give relationships between words in a sentence. For example,
they relate the subject and object of a sentence to a verb. Or, relate an
adjective to the noun that it modifies. We will use these extensively when
we get to stylometric analysis, but it is a good idea to start seeing how
they can be used even in a simple classification analysis. For example,
we can find which verbs are associated with sentences where the subject is
"I":

```{r}
token %>%
  left_join(
    select(token, doc_id, sid, tid_source = tid, lemma_source = lemma),
    by = c("doc_id", "sid", "tid_source")
  ) %>%
  filter(token == "I", relation == "nsubj") %>%
  group_by(lemma_source) %>%
  summarize(sm_count()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

Likewise, we can use these verbs to build a model:

```{r}
X <- token %>%
  left_join(select(token, doc_id, sid, tid_source = tid, lemma_source = lemma),
            by = c("doc_id", "sid", "tid_source")) %>%
  filter(token == "I", relation == "nsubj") %>%
  cnlp_utils_tf(doc_set = amazon$doc_id,
                min_df = 0.001,
                max_df = 1,
                max_features = 10000,
                token_var = "lemma_source")

dim(X)
```

Fitting it as before:

```{r}
X_train <- X[amazon$train_id == "train", ]
y_train <- amazon$category[amazon$train_id == "train"]

model <- cv.glmnet(X_train, y_train, alpha = 0.2, family = "multinomial")
```

As you might expect, this model is not nearly as predictive as it ignores
many of the useful features in the review. However, given it's limited
information, it does almost twice as well as random guessing would:

```{r}
amazon %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(model, newx = X, type = "class")) %>%
  group_by(train_id) %>%
  summarize(class_rate = mean(category == pred))
```

And as with the verb-based model, it is really the coefficents that are the
most interesting for us to work with:

```{r}
temp <- coef(model, s = model$lambda[14])
beta <- Reduce(cbind, temp)
beta <- beta[apply(beta != 0, 1, any),]
colnames(beta) <- names(temp)
beta
```

Do these also match your intuition for what verbs would be associated with
each product?
